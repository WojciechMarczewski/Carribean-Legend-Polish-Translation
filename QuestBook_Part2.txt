I suppose I will find him easily.
#TEXT 2
@<sCity> harbor master told me that captain @<sCapName> was sailing to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal> on @<sDate>.
#TEXT 3
They say that captain @<sCapName> is sailing from @<sCity> to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal>.
#TEXT 4
@<sCapName> is dead. Damn. My mission is failed.
#TEXT 5
I managed to find the captain I needed and inform him that his fellow was looking for him. My job is done. Time to return to @<sCity> and claim my coins.
#TEXT 10
The ship is gone. Now I won't be able to help my employer.
#QUEST SCQ_womanRevenge
Side Job: @<sCity>, Rejected Woman
#TEXT 1
I agreed to fulfill quite an unusual request for a woman. Her name is @<sName>, and she is a citizen of @<sCity>. I have to find captain @<sCapName>. He sails on @<sShipTypeName> '@<sShipName>'.
I must find him, board his vessel, and eliminate the man. Before I do so, I must inform him who is paying for his life.
Well, only rejected women seek revenge that hard...
#TEXT 2
@<sCity> harbor master told me that captain @<sCapName> was sailing to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal> on @<sDate>.
#TEXT 3
They say that captain @<sCapName> is sailing from @<sCity> to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal>.
#TEXT 4
The captain is dead. I wasn't able to talk to him, so the main term is broken. He wasn't informed why he died. The mission is failed.
#TEXT 5
Captain @<sCapName> is dead. I managed to do what my employer asked.
Fury's mission is finished. Now I may return to @<sCity> and claim my coins.
#TEXT 10
The ship I seek is gone. Revenge is failed.
#QUEST SCQ_womanPirates
Side Job: @<sCity>, Saving Captive Husband
#TEXT 1
I agreed to help a citizen of @<sCity> named @<sName>. Her husband is being held captive by captain @<sCapName>. He sails on @<sShipTypeName> '@<sShipName>'.
I have to find the captain, board his @<sShipTypeName2>, and release the poor woman's husband, whose name is @<sName2>.
#TEXT 2
@<sCity> harbor master told me that captain @<sCapName> was sailing to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal> on @<sDate>.
#TEXT 3
They say that captain @<sCapName> is sailing from @<sCity> to @<sTargetCity>@<sAreal>.
#TEXT 4
Captain @<sCapName> died, and so, apparently, did the woman's husband. The mission is failed.
#TEXT 5
Captain @<sName> is found. Now I must board his @<sShipTypeName>.
#TEXT 6
I managed to release the prisoner. The job is done. Time to return to @<sCity>.
#TEXT 10
The ship is gone. I won't be able to save the man.
#QUEST Slavetrader
Slave Trader
#TEXT 1
A usurer in @<sCity> called @<sName> offers me @<sSum> for @<sQty> slaves. The money is good, and the job is easy. I'll do it. I'd better not waste time. It seems that @<sName> has serious business, and I may make a lot of coins.
#TEXT 2
The slaves were delivered, and the money was received. Besides, @<sName> offered me another mission in three weeks. I should take it.
#TEXT 3
@<sName> ordered me to break his competitor's deal. I must capture '@<sShipName>', which is sailing to @<sShoreName> at @<sShoreType>. I have two weeks.
#TEXT 3_1
I was just in time! The captain of '@<sShipName>' is loading slaves onto a smuggler's vessel. I must board them both and claim their cargo.
#TEXT 4
The job is done. Time to see my employer.
#TEXT 5
My opponents were too tough for me, and I had to retreat. I'm afraid it's a failure.
#TEXT 5_5
I failed the mission, so @<sName> won't do any business with me again. What a shame...
#TEXT 6
@<sName> was pleased with my work. He paid me @<sMoney> pesos for @<sQty> slaves. I should also see him in a month.
#TEXT 7
I was too late, and '@<sShipName>' had already gone. I have to return empty-handed.
#TEXT 7_1
I was too slow, and the pinnace '@<sShipName>' had already gone. I have no idea where to find it. I have to return empty-handed.
#TEXT 7_2
Despite all my efforts, I wasn't able to find '@<sShipName>'. I have to return empty-handed.
#TEXT 8
I refused to do the job. I am not a bounty hunter.
#TEXT 9
I was a fool to work with this scum! Now I have to deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT 10
@<sName> assigned me to do quite a risky task this time. I have to board the pinnace @<sShipName>, which is sailing not far from here. I must be careful and avoid being shot by the fort.
#TEXT 11
The enemy was too strong. I failed to board '@<sShipName>'. I suppose I shouldn't even talk to my employer...
#TEXT 12
The pinnace '@<sShipName>' is at the bottom of the sea. No need to see my employer then...
#TEXT 13
Damn it! The pinnace '@<sShipName>' turned out to be a trap - there weren't any slaves inside it. Only armed soldiers. I should go and put some burning fuses between my employer's toes...
#TEXT 14
It looks like @<sName> was betrayed for real. The last words of the pinnace's captain prove that. The evidence is now sailing with the brigantine '@<sShipName>' towards @<sIsland> to the governor-general. I must board the ship and take the package with documents inside, or I will get in trouble otherwise.
#TEXT 15
Damn it! I failed to capture the brigantine '@<sShipName>'. Well, now it's time to visit a lawyer.
#TEXT 16
I managed to chase down and capture '@<sShipName>'. I also found the papers I needed. Now I can breathe freely.
#TEXT 17
I managed to chase down and capture '@<sShipName>', but there were no papers. Perhaps they are fake? I have to see the usurer.
#TEXT 18
I have to find and capture a heavy galleon '@<sShipName>' sailing @<sAreal> to Santiago. I must be attentive. There are three thousand slaves, truly a treasure!
#TEXT 19
That was unexpected. It wasn't a galleon; it was a goddamn battleship with a deadly skilled captain, yet I defeated him.
#TEXT 20
@<sName> asked me to wait for five days before he gathered the sum to pay me and gave me fifteen credit chests in advance. I find it hard to trust this scum, yet I doubt he will try to cheat me.
#TEXT 21
@<sName> asked me to search for and eliminate a traitor who caused our troubles. It will be my pleasure. His name is Francois Gontier, and he was last seen in Panama. I am on it.
#TEXT 21_1
The bartender in Panama told me that Gontier has likely gone to Porto Bello.
#TEXT 21_2
Gontier bought a corvette there. I have to find out where he went.
#TEXT 21_3
According to my information, Gontier went to Jamaica. His corvette is called '@<sShip>'.
#TEXT 21_4
Gontier was in Maroon Town, renting a room there, but now he is gone. I don't have any idea where to look for him.
#TEXT 21_5
A waitress told me she knows where Gontier went, but she asks for a pendant with gems in return. I must find this thing to reach Gontier.
#TEXT 21_6
Gontier went to Havana. Splendid. I guess I will see him soon.
#TEXT 21_7
Interesting! Gontier tried to get a Spanish privateer license but failed. The barman said he decided to choose France. So, time to visit Tortuga!
#TEXT 21_8
Something is very wrong! No sign of a corvette, yet Gontier and his men are walking around the streets. I must search the town and its outskirts.
#TEXT 21_9
The rat was hiding in one of the houses. I was attacked by his fellows as soon as I entered the room. I had to kill them, though I doubt they will be missed. Gontier escaped. His lover told me that his corvette was staying near the lighthouse of Tortuga. I must sail there before he is gone again!
#TEXT 21_10
I was too slow, and Gontier managed to run away. No clues are left. I may return to my employer and report the mission failure.
#TEXT 21_11
This Gontier was too tough for me, so I decided to retreat. I may return to my employer and report the mission failure.
#TEXT 21_12
It's done! That scum Gontier is feeding the sharks.
#TEXT 21_13
For eliminating the traitor, I was presented with an excellent spyglass. The usurer also paid me 100,000 pesos and 50,000 as compensation for my costs. It looks like my employer is standing up again. I must return in a month with a well-prepared squadron. The next mission is going to be serious.
#TEXT 21_14
@<sName> was upset, yet he offered me to visit him in a month with a well-prepared squadron. The next mission is going to be serious.
#TEXT 22
I was right. The barque suffered a wreck, and all the slaves had to hide at the Lighthouse. Tamango and his warriors attacked us, but we dealt with them. The rest of the runaways accepted their fate and surrendered. In total, I captured @<sQty> slaves.
#TEXT 22_1
@<sName> ordered me to sail to Curacao, which suffered from a great runaway of slaves. I must find out more about this incident.
#TEXT 22_2
I had an interesting talk with a barman. Now I know all the details concerning the riot. I also know someone has stolen a barque. The barman is sure the slaves did it.
#TEXT 22_3
The harbor master told me only the barque's name - '@<sShipName>'. That is all I have, unfortunately. I can't even imagine where to search next...
#TEXT 22_4
Surprisingly, I learned what I needed from a drunken sailor. The barque was seen at @<sAreal>. According to his story, the ship suffered a wreck. I should go there and search all the local bays.
#TEXT 22_5
@<sName> was pleased. He paid me 330,000 pesos for the Curacao slaves and @<sMoney> for the rest. I should see him in a month as usual.
#TEXT 22_6
@<sName> was pleased. He paid me @<sMoney> for @<sQty> slaves. I should see him in a month as usual.
#TEXT 24
Damn, I never thought @<sName> was that serious! Now I have to capture the fort of Havana. According to the information I got, there are 5,000 slaves. I am on my way.
#TEXT 25
The usurer was right. Two battleships are cruising near Havana's shores. They don't look friendly. I must get rid of them before I storm the fort.
#TEXT 26
The enemy's battleships were eliminated. Now it's time for the fort.
#TEXT 26_1
The enemy's battleships were eliminated, yet I am out of resources to assault Havana. I have to retreat. I suppose there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT 27
Havana was taken. The job is done. @<sQty> slaves were put in cargo holds. Time to return.
#TEXT 27_1
I failed the mission by attacking Havana from the land side. The slaves were kept inside the fort, and the defenders were able to prepare themselves. I suppose there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT 28
I was too late, and all the slaves were taken to Cuba's plantations. I suppose there is no need to return to my employer...
#TEXT 29
Damn it! Not all of the slaves survived the voyage, and the usurer wants 5,000, not a single slave less! I must find the rest in a week, or I will get in trouble otherwise.
#TEXT 30
I failed to deliver the slaves on time. Now, there is no need to hurry - I have to sell the slaves, visit agents, and deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT 31
I failed to gather 5,000 slaves on time. Now I must deal with bounty hunters...
#TEXT 32
The slaves were delivered to my employer. I should visit him in a week to collect my money. I will receive over a million for the job! Now, this is why I do this job! I can't even imagine what the next mission will bring. Yes, this business will make me rich!
#TEXT 33
The bastard screwed me! When I arrived for my coins, it turned out that my dear 'partner' had run away, taking my million and his investor's money. It's the first time I was cheated that hard! Yet he will get what he deserves. They all do. The world is small, we might meet each other again. And the rat will pay for everything!

#TEXT 1
Commandant of @<sCity> fort offered me to collect @<sQty> of @<sText>. His terms - I must deliver the entire batch a month later. Not earlier. I agreed, considering the price of the deal - @<sSum> pesos.
#TEXT 2
Cannons were delivered, payment received though not in coins but in credit chests. Works for me. So does for the commandant, I guess.
#TEXT 3
What a pity! The commandant refused to buy the cannons. And what am I supposed to do with this load of iron? I can only sell them to the shipyard for a few coins...
#TEXT 4
I spent too much time finding cannons, and @<sName> bought them from another seller. My fault...

Time for delivering has run out, and I should hurry up, or my client will suspect me of something wrong...
#TEXT 3_1
I was too slow. There is no need to hurry now...
#TEXT 4
I am late by @<sDay>. My payment was reduced, 5% for every day, so I got @<sMoney>. I should try better next time...
#TEXT 5
All terms are off now. If I want to deal with them again, I should visit the client and try to fix the situation...
#TEXT 6
I had to pay a fine - @<sMoney>. Though I can get a job again. I'd better check my trade journal now to find the best price for cargo...
#TEXT 7
These bureaucrats are damn too insolent! They wanted to rob me to my very cloth. I'd better hug the enemy than pay such a sum to those grafters.
#TEXT 8
Harbor master from @<sStartCity> has offered me to get and deliver @<sGoodQty> of @<sGoods> for their colony. He promised to pay @<sText> price. In total, I will get @<sMoney>.

I delivered a package. Although I didn't receive any coins, my reputation is clean.
#TEXT 10
Job is done, mail is delivered, payment received.
#TEXT 11
That was unlucky, I was forced to give a package to some scums. I must see my client and tell him the truth...
#TEXT 12
As soon as I left the harbor master's office, I was stopped by two masked guys. They looked like serious, professional mercenaries, I suppose. I preferred to fail my mission in order to stay alive. I should see the harbor master and explain the situation.
#TEXT 13
As soon as I left the harbor master's office, I met some man who offered to follow him to a tavern and have a talk concerning the package. I refused, that smelled bad.
#TEXT 14
I was attacked by a frigate right at the port; it seems that it is the ship of that damn agent who tried to 'deal' with me.
#TEXT 15
I had a nice opportunity to make some coins - I let the man copy those documents for @<sMoney>. Nice...
#TEXT 16
The agent tried to bribe me but failed. I am not Judas!
#TEXT 17
Well... My client noticed that the package was opened, it looks like the agent was not that professional. I didn't get any coins for delivery, and my reputation has suffered...

These bureaucrats are damn too insolent! They wanted to rob me to my very cloth. I'd better hug the enemy than pay such a sum to those grafters.
#TEXT 10
I was unable to keep the ships safe. Mission is failed.

Unfortunately, one of the ships was sunk while fighting an enemy. I managed to save another, though I didn't get any reward. I should learn more about tactics to avoid further mistakes... They only paid for cargo delivery - @<sMoney>.
#TEXT 13
Voyage was extremely unfortunate - one of the ships was sunk while fighting an enemy. Besides, I've lost a significant amount of cargo. My client refused to pay, and he also demanded compensation for the lost cargo - @<sMoney>. I decided to accept his terms; I don't want to make enemies.

#TEXT 26
I've lost too much time dealing with my problems. No need to sail to @<sIsland>. Mission is failed.
#TEXT 27
I managed to find '@<sSName>' near the island. It is barely holding up; it lost its mast and most of its crew. It won't be able to sail without a serious repair. I have to buy materials in the nearest colony and deliver them here. I need planks - @<sQty1>, sailcloth - @<sQty2>, cotton - @<sQty3>.
#TEXT 28
I wasted too much time, and the captain of '@<sSName>' has already sailed away on his damaged vessel. Mission is failed.

Repair is finished. We may head to @<sStartCity>.

I reported to the harbor master and received @<sMoney> pesos.

#TEXT 38
I didn't find '@<sSName>' near the shores of @<sIsland>, but I managed to find its captain and crew at the bay called @<sShore>. I have taken them aboard immediately; those Indians seemed to be clear in their intentions.
#TEXT 39
As soon as we reached the sea, we were attacked by a pirate corvette; it must be the corvette which the captain was talking about. I have destroyed the pirates.
#TEXT 40
I have reached @<sStartCity>. The ex-captain presented me @<sMoney> and an amulet for my assistance. His crew will stay with me.

A merchant of @<sCity> is in trouble - he can't leave his shop for a second. I should deliver his letter to the commandant by the end of the day. I will be paid 300 pesos.
#TEXT 2
It looks like someone is trying to destroy the merchant's business by selling goods illegally and cheaply. I signed up to help. I think I should start with the local smugglers; they must have something to do about it...
#TEXT 3
My talk with smugglers was worthless. My mistake, I suppose. No clues are left; I suppose the merchant will have to deal with it himself.
#TEXT 4
I was too slow. Mission is failed.
#TEXT 5
I managed to cheat on smugglers - they have appointed me a meeting. I should come to the local harbor master's office at night; they will meet me there and show the way to that illegal shop. I can either talk with the commandant and let him deal with them, or I can do it all myself...
#TEXT 6
I missed the meeting. Mission is failed.

I decided to give all the information to the commandant. He ensured me that the scums will be arrested tonight. I should visit the merchant in a few days and receive my reward.

I was led to the lair where I met the competitor. I managed to frighten him; he ran away and paid me well. Now I may return to the merchant and claim my reward.
#TEXT 9
I was led to the lair where I met the competitor. Negotiating ended in a fight. I killed two of his men, and he begged for his life. I've let him go and confiscated all his things and coins. I doubt that he would risk trading in this town again. Now I may return to the merchant and claim my reward.
#TEXT 10
I was led to the lair where I met the competitor. Negotiating ended in a fight. I killed the man and two of his fellows. I suppose that is the best solution; he won't be able to harm people again. Now I may return to the merchant and claim my reward.

I have received 15,000 pesos for dealing with the competitor. Nice...

#TEXT 1_1
I've secured the wine. During our discussion, the soldier mentioned he'll be awaiting me atop the fort come next day.

A week has passed, and my friend soldier has probably gone to the sea as he told me. No need to worry now about his request...
#TEXT 3
I paid 1,000 coins, and now I know who sells wine in large numbers. It's @<sName>, he owns the local shop. I should see him.
#TEXT 4
Those merchants are way too greedy. They won't tell you a single word for free. And I won't pay this scum.
#TEXT 5
Surprise. @<sName> doesn't trade wine. Looks like that huckster has lied to me. We should have a talk.
#TEXT 6

I have found the thief. He refused to part with the stolen item peacefully and committed armed resistance.

Locals told me that there was some tramp with the tool I seek. That is all I've got, unfortunately. I doubt that the thief could run far away. I should search the town and its outskirts.

#QUEST Sunplace
Side Job: Assassination
#TEXT 1
@<sName>, who owns the shop in @<sCity>, asked me to do a really uncommon job. I have to deliver some troubles to his competitor - capture his ship with cargo or sink it. I agreed, normally I have to pay for the information about valuable prizes. And now I will be paid. The man promised @<sMoney>, the ship, and @<sGoods> in its cargo holds. I have to look for @<sType> '@<sSName>' not far from @<sShore> in @<sDay>.
#TEXT 2
I was too late. The ship has gone, and I won't get any cargo. Perhaps I should solve the problem myself in a more radical way? To kill his competitor once and for all. The result will be the same... My target is living somewhere in @<sCity>.
#TEXT 3
I am just in time! I can see the target. To arms!
#TEXT 4
It was a good fight. I can return to my employer.
#TEXT 5
Damn it! The captain of this old tub was too good for me. Perhaps I should solve the problem myself in a more radical way? To kill his competitor once and for all. The result will be the same... My target is living somewhere in @<sCity>.
#TEXT 6
The barman told me that @<sName> is in the local shop now. Well, it's time to pay him a visit.
#TEXT 7
The barman told me that @<sName> is having a sea trip now. I should look for his lugger.
#TEXT 8
@<sName> is eliminated. I suppose that my client will be pleased. No man - no problem.
#TEXT 9
I've changed my mind. Killing an unarmed man is not my style.
#TEXT 10
I decided to leave the merchant's lugger alone. Killing a peaceful man is not my style.
#TEXT 11
I have changed my mind, and I am not going to take part in their fight.
#TEXT 12
The client was satisfied and paid me well.
#TEXT 13
Really?! I have overdone my job, and he is not happy! I don't trust his words about 'heavy sins' - the man is definitely lacking conscience. Looks like he had his plans. Hell with him, he paid me anyway.
#TEXT 14
I am just in time. Surprisingly, '@<sSName>' is not a @<sType>, it is a heavy galleon. It looks like the client was mistaken. But, perhaps, there are no @<sGoods> in its cargo holds? Anyway, I have to fight.

I was too angry because of my failure, so I attacked the merchant right in the port. Such an idiot I am. Blind fury, so they say...

#QUEST RedChieftain
Indian Chief
#TEXT 1
Kanauri, the Indian Chief, asked for my assistance. His tribesmen were enslaved by @<sText1> ship. The chief asked me to free his people who are forced to dive for pearls. I agreed; I will get all of their catch after all. Two schooners are watching Indians, and there is a well-defended camp on the shore. An important detail - I must approach them on a small ship like a lugger or sloop to stay hidden long enough. I have only one month to do the job. So I'd better not waste any time.
#TEXT 2
I was too slow, and the Indians must have already been taken away. Eh, my fault... I will land Kanauri in the nearest port; I failed him.
#TEXT 3
I managed to stay hidden long enough to engage the enemy. Bastards are shooting at unarmed fishers. I must destroy them as soon as possible before the Indians are dead.
#TEXT 4
I was warned by the chief to use a single small ship! No sign of Indian tartans, it seems that the Indians were driven away to the jungles. Damn it! I can leave now...
#TEXT 5
The enemy schooners are destroyed. Now I should land and clear the bay of soldiers to let the Indians escape into the jungles. Besides, I am confident that I can find some loot in the fisher's camp...
#TEXT 6
The schooners were too tough for me. Of course! I had only one ship, which is weaker than any of them... I had enough; Kanauri will be landed in the nearest port. He'd better find another 'savior'...
#TEXT 7
The fight was awful; all Indian tartans destroyed. There is no one to save now. I will land Kanauri in the nearest port; I failed him.
#TEXT 8
All enemies are dead. The Indians paid me well and went to the jungles. I respect people like Kanauri; he is a true chief of his tribe.
#TEXT 9
All enemies are dead. The Indians paid me in full with the pearls they got and went through the jungle to their village. The leader even gave me a charmed amulet as a reward, with which it is supposedly impossible to drown. I sincerely respect people like Kanauri - he is a worthy leader of his tribe.

#QUEST FalseTrace
False Trace
#TEXT 1
I had an interesting meeting in the port of @<sCity1>. A man called Adam Rayner offered me a deal. He told me about a galleon '@<sShip>' loaded with silver. It is sailing from Cartagena to @<sCity2>. He demanded one-tenth of the booty. I accepted his terms, considering that he will sail with me, and he even asked to take part in the boarding party. Adam didn't tell me any timing, yet I suppose that I have only two or three weeks.
#TEXT 2
Despite my efforts, I failed to board the galleon. Whatever, hell with the silver.
#TEXT 3
I have sunk the galleon with all of its silver. How could I be that inattentive...
#TEXT 4
Isn't that something! There was no silver inside the galleon. The captain says that it's only a fodder ship supposed to deliver provision. But there was also a woman; she is obviously the captain's lover. Right, I should call Adam to my cabin and have a talk. Let's see what this bastard will tell me in excuse. And he'd better try damn hard to save his neck from a rope...
#TEXT 5
Adam Rayner admitted that his plan was to capture the galleon with my help and to get his wife, who has run away from him. Her name is Katerine Rayner. He offers to tell me about the gold of some Squint-Eyed Solly as a reward for my 'services'. But, first, I have to deliver him and his wife to @<sCity>. Should I trust this rogue? Perhaps, I have to talk with his wife first; she might know something important...
#TEXT 6
It is getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam just like a dog hates a cat... That is why she ran away from him. But it is just their family matters and their problems. I didn't like Katerine and her proposal, so I'd risk trusting Adam again. To @<sCity> then.
#TEXT 7
It is getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam just like a dog hates a cat... That is why she ran away from him. Katerine is eager to revenge her husband for organizing the attack, which led to her lover's death. She offered me to kill her husband, and she will tell me about his hidden cache in return. I don't trust Adam anymore, so I have accepted her terms. I will sail to @<sCity>, but I will land on the nearest shore, not in the town. I will deal with Adam there.
#TEXT 8
It is getting more interesting. Katerine hates Adam just like a dog hates a cat... That is why she ran away from him. Katerine claims that her captain can offer more for their freedom. I should go and talk to the prisoner.
#TEXT 9
The captain's offer was much more suspicious than Adam's. It looks like he is trying to set a trap for me. Not a chance! I'd better trust Adam one more time. I am heading to @<sCity>.
#TEXT 10
The captain's offer seemed much more profitable and interesting than Adam's one. Who lied once - will do it again. I will arrest Rayner and put him in the cargo hold.
#TEXT 11
Adam Rayner is arrested, though he offered resistance. Now he is chained, and I am heading to @<sShore>.
#TEXT 12
I was too slow, and Adam Rayner had stolen a boat, took his wife, and escaped from my ship. I doubt that I will see them again...
#TEXT 13
I was too slow, and Squint-Eyed Solly has already taken his treasures. I should have tried better...
#TEXT 14
I have transported Adam and his wife to @<sCity>. Adam told me that Solly has left his booty inside the grotto at San Juan del Norte bay. I am heading there, only five days remaining.
#TEXT 15
I was too slow, and Squint-Eyed Solly has already taken his treasures. I should have tried better...
#TEXT 16
That was one hell of a fight! Solly's bandits were eliminated. There is so much treasure that it will take several voyages to transport it.
#TEXT 17
As soon as I got aboard, I saw Solly's ship. Well, too bad for him then.
#TEXT 18
As soon as I got aboard, I saw Solly's ship. He was too strong for me, so I had to retreat and leave all the booty on the shore...
#TEXT 19
My former prisoner has kept his word and gave me information - in two weeks, a heavy galleon loaded with golden ore will be sailing from @<sCity> to Europe. I am on it. No need to worry about Adam, I suppose...
#TEXT 20
Despite all my efforts, I failed to capture the galleon. Fine, hell with the gold.
#TEXT 21
I have sunk the galleon with all of its gold. Such an idiot...
#TEXT 22
The heavy galleon was captured. The captain was right; there was a lot of gold!
#TEXT 23
Adam Rayner was killed in sight of his wife as she desired. It's odd, but she was pleased by the scene of his death. She told me about Adam's hidden cache - Port-au-Prince, lighthouse.
#TEXT 24
I've found Adam's cache. His gang attacked me while I was heading back to my boat. Katerine prepared the ambush; she wanted to revenge for her lover's death. It wasn't easy, but I managed to kill all four bandits. Katerine was too confident and decided to watch my execution. And got a bullet in the skull for her treachery. No more surprises.

#QUEST Portugal
Long Way to the Gallows
#TEXT 1
I have heard an interesting story from some drunk bounty hunter! It seems that a famous pirate Bartolomeo the Portuguese is somewhere in Philipsburg; he is looking for a doctor. The Dutch West India Company will pay a great coin for his head. Hugo is right; I don't want to lose a chance like this. I should search the town and find the rat before it's gone!
#TEXT 2
I failed to find the pirate, and I won't see any reward. Who knows, perhaps, it is for the best...
#TEXT 3
Hugo Avendell persuaded me to avoid local authorities and deliver the Portuguese straight to the Company. He thinks that the local governor will take away our prey and find a way to cheat on us. I should change the Portuguese's clothes; his men might still be in the town. I need to find him some appropriate clothes.
#TEXT 4
Damn it! I was too slow; the Portuguese managed to run away from us. There is a smell of gunpowder in the room, poor doctor. I can forget about any reward now.
#TEXT 5
The doctor said that the Portuguese is too bad, and he likely won't survive a trip to Curacao. My last chance is to take him to Gino Gvineili. If the genius won't be able to help him, no one will. But we are lacking time; we have only three days.
#TEXT 6
I am late; fever did its job. Too bad that the pirate didn't live long enough for the gallows...
#TEXT 7
We have arrived at Antigua, and the Portuguese is still alive. I won't let my prisoner die before I receive my promised doubloons. But it is all about Gino and his skills now.
#TEXT 8
I knew that we have spent too much time here! They have finally tracked us down, but these are not the Portuguese's men; they are mercs. I had to calm them down. Now we have only five days to reach Martinique. My prisoner will be able to rest in Saint-Pierre's tavern and live long enough to reach Curacao. Hugo suspects that there are more cutthroats around us; perhaps, I will be forced to fight them.
#TEXT 9
I was asked to visit His Grace the governor due to some important business. Interesting. Anyway, the Portuguese will be resting in the tavern for a few days, so I've got enough time to talk with monsieur Jacques Dille du Parquet.
#TEXT 10
His Grace is asking me to patrol the waters of his colony for two days; they have seen some pirate frigate recently. Well, fear has big eyes, and I always can use more 10,000 pesos. I agreed; I have to stay here for a few days anyway while the Portuguese is resting...
#TEXT 11
Two days have passed, and there is still no sign of the pirate frigate. Time to see His Grace.
#TEXT 12
Hugo is an idiot! No, I am wrong... he is a coward! That is the best word to describe him. And why haven't I thrown him away before? He did nothing to help our deed. Fine, it will cost him in our sharing. Now I should check the tavern and talk with the barman. He must have seen something!
#TEXT 13
I was able to find out that our client was taken from our loving arms by some Franz Garcke and Hernando Vazquez. Hugo knows them. He was frightened and ran away as soon as our cutthroats showed up. His participation in our business is getting more and more questionable. But it will wait; I am sure that they have taken our man to Le Francois. Where else could men like them be hiding? Only under the protection of Jacques the Kindman. I must try to intercept them there. I should sail to the port of Le Francois and prevent them from taking my prisoner on their ship!
#TEXT 14
I've met Garcke's men, as I expected. Too bad for them... Time to talk with their boss - he must be upstairs with my prisoner!
#TEXT 15
The Portuguese was put in the room; our doctor is watching over him. I am so damn tired of this... I'd better walk around the town; I have got two days of rest.
#TEXT 16
I failed to find the Portuguese, and I likely won't. Too bad.
#TEXT 17
I was able to catch Bartolomeo the Portuguese, yet I had to deal with his former companions who weren't really eager to let him live. I should talk with my prisoner when we are out of here; something is very wrong with him.
#TEXT 18
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate - 'Albatross'. Hugo feared him. I am victorious, but there was no sign of Vazquez aboard... I'd better talk with my prisoner.
#TEXT 19
As I expected, I was attacked by Vazquez's frigate - 'Albatross'. I preferred to avoid fighting and escaped from the frigate. I should deliver the prisoner to Curacao, but first, I'd better talk with him.
#TEXT 20
Eh, I am too kind! I have been saving the Portuguese so often that I just can't let him be hanged. Hell with him, he may leave me in the first port...
#TEXT 21
Enough of sentimentalizing with this scum. I had enough of him... Heading to Curacao, to Matthias Beck.
#TEXT 22
It's done. The Portuguese was delivered to his judges, and coins are mine. I have to admit, I am not satisfied with this story. Gino was damn right; saving a man's life to hang him later... it's not right.
#TEXT 23
I decided to let Bartolomeo go; besides, he offered a good price for his freedom. He has got a hidden cache on Terks filled with gems, which he has taken from the Company, and they are also the reason why they are all hunting for him. I hope that he wasn't lying to save his life... He also warned me about Vazquez; he might be a problem in the future. Now I should look for the treasure before the savages find it. What did he say? On the hill under the tree?
#TEXT 24
I witnessed a fight between Indians and Dutch marines. What are they doing here? Both sides didn't really appreciate me, so I had to fight all of them. It was tough, yet they are all dead, and I am standing. Now I can search for the treasure.
#TEXT 25
The Portuguese didn't lie! I have found the gems he was talking about. A proper ending for such an insane story.
#TEXT 26
I was engaged by a Dutch frigate near the shores of Terks. I fought them and destroyed them. I don't think that they came here just to walk around this cozy island; it is got to be something about Bartolomeo's treasure. Perhaps I will find something out in the nearest Dutch colony? I should talk with the tavern folks.
#TEXT 27

I should talk with the tavern folks.
#TEXT 28
Why should I care about the Company's intrigues? After all, I have got the gems; it is all that matters...
#TEXT 29
It seems that I found out what is going on. Hernando Vazquez. He didn't risk fighting me on Martinique - I am sure he had a nice sight of his frigate's last fight. He wanted to save his life; that is why he told the Company about the gems. And he didn't want to meet me at Curacao; that is why he came here, to Philipsburg. He sent the Dutch expedition on Terks.
Well, Blood Don has been living enough; time to end him before he knows about my presence here. I should go directly to the governor; I'd better ask his servants.
#TEXT 30
I have changed my mind. Vazquez is not a threat to me - the Dutch won't let him live; they didn't find any gems on Terks. I can breathe freely, I am confident...
#TEXT 31
Isn't that something! They have captured the Portuguese! They say that he and Vazquez will be executed in a month. It is obvious that the Company is going to interrogate them at first. I should decide what to do. The Portuguese might tell them about my role in this mess...
#TEXT 32
Bartolomeo is being held with his fellow Vazquez in Willemstad's dungeons. Ha! Should I take a risk? Or hell with it?
#TEXT 33
I decided to stay away from this risky and, what is more important, worthless gamble. Even if the Portuguese opens his mouth, well, he won't be able to tell much. There are hundreds of captains like me. Hell, he doesn't even know my name.
#TEXT 34
I have freed Bartolomeo from the prison. I barely made it, yet Vazquez attacked me from behind. Thank God Bartolomeo warned me, and the shot wasn't lethal. Now there is nothing to worry about. I must admit, I did it for another reason. Like it or not, Gino was right; we are responsible for those who we tamed.
#TEXT 35
The Portuguese didn't survive the fight with the bounty hunters...

#QUEST Consumption
Price of Consumption
#TEXT 1
The waitress of San Jose tavern is desperate - she is confident that her brother, who was put in the local dungeons for smuggling, didn't die of illness as she was told. Perhaps, he might be in trouble, and I could not stay indifferent to the tears of such a beautiful girl, so I promised to help. It is odd that her brother died in two weeks after getting inside the dungeons. There is a probability that Senor Commandant is holding something back. I also should ask common folks about this strange epidemic; sometimes, gossips are the best source of information.
#TEXT 2
Didn't get much from the innkeeper. Yet he confirmed my suspicions. It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year, and no one would care. Or they just pretend? I also got one more clue: there was a smuggler who had been inside the dungeons and survived. He died after all, yet it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should talk with his fellows - they might tell me some details.
#TEXT 3
Senor Commandant didn't appreciate my interest. Even more, he tried to show me the door. Well, I admit, the man was extremely polite and patient. I will try to find out more about Senor Commandant.
#TEXT 4
The innkeeper has confirmed my suspicions. It seems that consumption has been killing men for a year, and no one would care. Or they just pretend? About Senor Commandant... He was sent here due to some of his machinations back in Europe. He fortified his house and never left it without guards. The man is definitely hiding something. Something about consumption in his dungeons. I should check his house. I also got another clue: there was a smuggler who had been inside the dungeons and lived. He died after all, yet it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should talk with his fellows - they might tell me some details.
#TEXT 5
My suspicions regarding Senor Commandant are getting stronger. They say that he was sent here due to some of his machinations back in Europe. He fortified his house and never leaves it without guards. The man is definitely hiding something. Something about consumption in his dungeons. I should check his house. I also got another clue: there was a smuggler who had been inside the dungeons and lived. He died after all, yet it happened outside the prison. Perhaps I should talk with his fellows - they might tell me some details.
#TEXT 6
It seems that our consumption has got a name. Juan. Whatever it means, it is not just another illness that kills people in prisons. I should ask the locals about this Juan.
#TEXT 7
I have found an interesting letter inside Commandant's house. It looks like our colonel deals with a man whose name starts with 'J'. I also found coins, his share from the last deal.
Well, I am starting to understand what kind of cargo they trade.
#TEXT 8
A Spanish officer approached me in the streets. He looked disturbed and begged me to stop asking people about Juan and consumption. He has appointed a meeting outside the town gates tonight. I feel that I am on the right way.
#TEXT 9
I was late, and the Spanish doctor is gone. It seems that he was also taken by 'consumption'. Too bad.
#TEXT 10
The officer who promised me to tell the truth about consumption is dead. The only way to reach Juan is ended. Too bad.
#TEXT 11
So, Officer Sergio Saldo told me everything. Senor Commandant is really selling his prisoners, formalizing their disappearances as deaths from consumption. Funny, his trading partner is called Consumption. Juan 'Consumption'. His men tried to kill us both during our meeting; it seems that I have alerted their gang. Time to find the rest of them and kill them all. Sergio told me that Juan's ship would be sailing not far from Galera Point till midday. It looks like Angelo still has got a chance to return home...
#TEXT 12
The fighting is done; the ship was sunk. Now I should return to the waitress.
#TEXT 13
I have sunk Juan's ship with all the prisoners it was carrying. What a shame! I have to be more careful next time...
#TEXT 14
Juan was too tough for me, so I preferred to retreat; I care about my life's safety...
#TEXT 15
I was late to Galera Point, and Juan's ship has gone... Damn it.
#TEXT 16
Juan, the slave trader, paid me well for his life. Young and noble Officer Sergio will likely arrest Senor Commandant, but Juan will find a way to continue his business. And the girl... well, she'd better stay ignorant about her brother's fate.
#TEXT 17
Juan has escaped from his deserved fate; I had to leave him to save the slaves. Angelo will return to his sister, and Consumption... perhaps, we shall meet again one day, and I will be able to end what I've started...
#TEXT 18
End of the story. Consumption is dead, and he will never continue his dirty hunt for people. Angelo will return to his sister, just like a lot of other people will return to their families today. I am not sure that Senor Commandant will be punished, yet it is not my problem...

Price of Discretion
#TEXT 1
I was approached by a man named Bertrand Pinette in the streets of Basse-Terre. He offered me to deliver him and two of his friends to Mosquitoes bay of Spanish Maine in ten days. I took the job. I should see my passengers at Capster beach at ten o'clock tonight.
#TEXT 2
It's midnight already, and I am too late to pick up my passengers.
#TEXT 3
All passengers are aboard, time to set sail. An odd group they are. A Spanish officer and a French officer. Both are very secretive and don't talk at all. What was a Spanish military doing on a French island? I have a bad feeling about this.
#TEXT 4
The ten-day term has expired, and I still haven't reached my destination. I should hurry.
#TEXT 5
My voyage to Maine took way too long, and the scum passengers had started a mutiny. They are all dead now. Good riddance.
#TEXT 6
The passengers were delivered. I should get as far as possible from the Spanish shores.
#TEXT 7
My guts were right; this deliver of Bertrand Pinette and his girls turned out to be more profitable in terms of troubles than money. A runaway war captive, a deserter, and a fraud - what a company. I am sure Pinette made a fortune on this voyage. As for me, I am obliged to find Pinette and bring him back to Guadeloupe. Nothing I can do about it; I am being blackmailed by this bastard banker. I should sail to Panama since it was my passengers' final destination. I also should remember to keep my mouth shut in the future!
#TEXT 8
I didn't find neither Pinette nor his ladies in Panama. Figures, he must have lied to me out of caution. I should head to Portobello now.
#TEXT 9
A bartender gave me beautiful advice to directly address Don Carlos de Milyar regarding Pinette. Nice. This would be the best way possible to end up in a local prison. The bartender's smug face tells me that he knows much more than he told me. I should persuade him to share with me.
#TEXT 10
So, no sign of Pinette here, although I managed to find a trail of the third passenger - the French deserter. He is a Spanish don now, a commander of the Sario. His reward for treason, I imagine. I have no other option rather than to board his tub and to capture 'Don Juan'. Even if he won't be able to point me to Bertrand's location, I could use him to ease the anger of the governor of Guadeloupe.
#TEXT 11
Looks like I was lucky: a war schooner 'Sario' is stationed in Portobello. Boarding it in front of a fort wouldn't be my brightest idea. I should wait for it to leave the harbor and head into the open sea.
#TEXT 12
The Sario is in the open sea. I should chase her!
#TEXT 13
I made a mistake and attacked the Sario in the port of Portobello. Jean-Juan is dead. All leads are gone, and I have no clue where to find Pinette. I should expect trouble with the French authorities.
#TEXT 14
Don Juan is captured and put in my cargo hold. I should talk to him about Pinette.
#TEXT 15
I failed to board the Sario and capture Jean-Juan. All leads are gone, and I have no clue where to find Pinette. I should expect trouble with the French authorities.
#TEXT 16
My prisoner is ready to share information about Bertrand Pinette. Heading to Mosquito Bay.
#TEXT 17
Bertrand Pinette has decided to continue his dirty business on Barbados. I should search for him on the biggest plantation there.
#TEXT 18
This bastard Pinette refused to follow me to my ship. Had to teach him a lesson. I may have problems with the French authorities, but this particular filth is harmless now.
#TEXT 19
This bastard Pinette refused to follow me to my ship. It was stupid to expect otherwise from him. Lesson learned. Now I should walk around the plantation and make up a plan to capture monsieur Bertrand by force.
#TEXT 20
I have a plan: there is a road from the plantation to the lighthouse of Barbados. I should station my ship near the lighthouse and set an ambush for Pinette near a crossroad between the town and the plantation. I need to find a place where I can stay out of sight long enough. Bertrand constantly visits Bridgetown for business matters, so I don't think it will take more than a few days of waiting for him.
#TEXT 21
I didn't dare to attack Pinette; he had a very impressive guard. Now I should run away; he saw my ambush and will undoubtedly inform the commandant. Pity, now I should expect problems with the French authorities...
#TEXT 22
Bertrand Pinette is my prisoner now. I should return to Basse-Terre to see the banker.
#TEXT 23
It's done. I got my cash and my reputation. These 150 doubloons won't compensate for all my troubles, but it's still something. That was the price for my indiscretion.
#TEXT 24
Pinette has offered me an interesting solution - a letter compromising the banker from Basse-Terre. Don Juan was right about the aces in the man's hand. It would be a pleasure to see the face of my blackmailer. Not to mention Bertrand's stash waiting for me in a cave on Guadeloupe.
#TEXT 25
Pinette's letter made a lasting impression on the banker. He will keep quiet, that's for sure. I should check Bertrand's stash now; it's too risky to let it stay there for too long.
#TEXT 26
I was attacked by several mercenaries hired by my good banker from Basse-Terre. Seems like he considers me a dangerous witness and wants me dead. Very well, I should pay him a visit again.

I met a carpenter at Saint-Pierre shipyard today. He told me that the shipbuilder is asking me to pay him a visit. I believe it will be worth the while; he obviously wants my services.
#TEXT 2
I've changed my mind and decided not to pay the shipbuilder a visit.
#TEXT 3
The shipbuilder's request to attack a Spanish trade convoy didn't pique my interest, so I refused.
#TEXT 4
The shipbuilder has offered me the task of tracking down a Spanish convoy sailing from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. I have to board the Bensecho, loaded with rare and valuable resin. If I succeed, my profit will be around 1500 doubloons!
#TEXT 5
The Bensecho was sunk in the heat of the fight. What a pity.
#TEXT 6
I let the trade convoy and the Bensecho slip away. What a pity...
#TEXT 7
I boarded the Bensecho but failed to find enough resin barrels to satisfy my client. What a shame.
#TEXT 8
The Bensecho was plundered, and I've got the resin in my cargo hold. Time to see my client.
#TEXT 9
It's been more than a month since I got this job. Saint-Pierre's shipbuilder must have completely forgotten about me by now.
#TEXT 10
I was fooled in the most insolent way: the shipbuilder and his fellow lieutenant named Felicien Gronier have screwed me by performing an excellent play called 'Arrest of the good-hearted smuggler.' No way I am letting them get away with this. Gregoire Valinnie was right - patience is the key here. I should stay for a while in Saint-Pierre and see when the shipyard will start working again.
#TEXT 11
It didn't take too long. Two days, and the shipyard is working again as usual. I should pay a visit to the shipbuilder and look into his deceiving eyes.
#TEXT 12
This conman told me the most sad story about his 'awful time in prison' without turning a hair. He's an accomplished bastard, no point in exerting pressure on him. He also has a colonial lieutenant as a dearest friend and partner in crime. I need a plan...
#TEXT 13
It appears that there are not only hordes of bastards and scums around me. I have friends too! My good old noble acquaintance Gregoire Valinnie, on his own initiative, has tracked down Felicien Gronier's most recent operations. The lieutenant has sailed to Guadeloupe on a freshly built tartane called 'Topaz.' I should follow him and find out what he's up to.
#TEXT 14
I took my time and let Felicien Gronier slip away. No way I can compensate for my losses now.
#TEXT 15
I've found the tartane around Guadeloupe, or to be more specific, near the deserted shores of Morn l'O Bay. Looks like they are unloading goods to the shore. I should wait for them to finish, disembark, and 'confiscate' the resin they owe me. They cannot escape from me there.
#TEXT 16
I approached too close to the Topaz and alerted her crew: the tartane is sailing away to the open sea, and there is activity on the shores. I spoiled my own plan, no point in landing there now. I am sure those bastards will manage to hide the merchandise in the jungles.
#TEXT 17
The Topaz has finished unloading and is sailing away at the moment. I should wait for a few hours and then land on the shore. Time to get my resin back.
#TEXT 18
We've slaughtered the scum on the shore, but it's not a victory yet. Lieutenant Felicien Gronier is here, in the flesh. Looks like he had a feeling and decided to return. Great timing, you resin dog! He also has five serious fighters by his side. They are standing there like statues, waiting...
#TEXT 19
I didn't take my chances against Felicien Gronier's squad - they had that look. I'd rather stay with less plunder loot but alive. Half of the resin is a very satisfying result anyway.
#TEXT 20
Felicien Gronier tried to threaten me, yet it didn't turn out so well for him and his friends - they are staying forever on this shore. I made some calculations: even though there really was only half of my resin, I also got ship silk, hemp ropes, and ironwood in addition. My losses are compensated with profit!
#TEXT 21
The Topaz attacked me when I was leaving the bay. What made this small tartane engage in her last fight is a mystery to me.
#TEXT 22
I delayed landing on the shore for too long, and Felicien Gronier's men are gone now. Pity, what a pity...

Lieutenant Caspar Gratton decided that I would assist him in his military operation against Holland. No way. Escaping from Sint-Maarten is his problem now.

I delivered lieutenant Caspar Gratton and his soldiers to Sint-Maarten yet didn't get paid. Instead, the lieutenant requested I wait for him for a few days, then take his squad to Antigua, where Colonel Fox will generously pay me in full. No shit, sir. I hope the Dutch won't learn about this, as aiding and abetting British military operations is not considered a good deed in their book... I should sail to Philipsburg and investigate the situation. I also wonder what the marines are up to?
#TEXT 5
Three days have passed, and I learned nothing. I should return to Grand Case beach - maybe the lieutenant is already there?

Lieutenant Caspar Gratton didn't show up after all. I have a feeling he never will. I should get the hell out of here before it's too late.

This is just getting better and better... I brought an English raiding party to Sint-Maarten with a mission to infiltrate a prison in Philipsburg and release captive English officers! If the Dutch learn about this, they will screw me. Should I try to find my passengers in the jungles and warn them about the ambush? Or perhaps it's better to run away from here as quickly as possible?

But it's fine, the governor offered me to take part in a hunt for English spies and promised a hefty reward for any solid information. If he'd only known who he was talking to... I got to find the Brits and warn them, or if it's too late, run away from this island.

I have ruined Jacobsen's cunning play by being late to our meeting. Wonderful. Did he manage to sneak poisoned wine into the prison? No clue what to do next. No, there is one - I should run away from here!

A duplicate key is already made, and at this moment, it is in the hands of some pirate who is sinking himself in a tavern bottle. How did it all go like that, I wonder? Is the dame playing me? Or is she stupid? At any rate, I need money; Michel will not leave his cell on his own.

Grandee Albalate
#TEXT 1
I helped a man called don Domingo Albalate tonight by getting him out of a dirty mess. He is a young Spanish grandee and asked me to pay him a visit in Santo-Domingo. His house is right by the city gates.
#TEXT 2
I've decided not to go to Santo-Domingo. This is a Spanish city, after all.
#TEXT 3
I wasn't met by don Domingo. Instead, there were some odd and aggressive characters. They must have been waiting for Albalate. I should search the place and investigate.
#TEXT 4
I've found the corpse of the real Ugo - don Domingo's retainer. There was also a curious unfinished note on a table: 'young senor, I don't understand what is really going on yet, but you are in great danger. I know that such words mean nothing to you but, please, for the sake of your father - please, leave the city as soon as you can! I've found documents of your uncle's...' Obviously, someone is after the young don. His old retainer tried to warn his master, but they didn't let him.
#TEXT 5
I listened to don Albalate's story and agreed to take him to his plantation in Portobello. He paid really well in advance, plus it's a good deed to help a young senor in trouble. Heading south with haste before the young grandee's uncle returns from Cartagena.
#TEXT 6
It took too long for me to reach Portobello, and don Albalate lost his patience and left me.
#TEXT 7
Here we are at the Portobello plantation. We should find the house of Luis Ortiz and search for any clues inside.
#TEXT 8
I've found Ortiz's accounting book. Domingo fell into great excitement after he read the notes - turns out that his uncle had been fooling him for years by lowering the real income several times. Grandee Albalate is going to Portobello to address the court of law.
#TEXT 9
That was unexpected. Opposed by the suddenly appeared don Luis Ortiz and his thugs, I decided to leave them to deal with their family matters on their own. Besides, I was paid well...
#TEXT 10
Don Diego and I finally met Luis Ortiz face to face as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me but failed, and now he is dead. Alas, the same can be said about poor grandee Albalate. What a shame... I should run away from here before the authorities consider me an accomplice.
#TEXT 11
Don Diego and I finally met Luis Ortiz face to face as soon as we left his house. The bastard tried to bribe me but failed, and now he and his minions are feeding maggots. Don Domingo intends to immediately start dealing with his property. I should see him tomorrow and claim my reward.
#TEXT 12
This is the end of the curious case of don Albalate. The young grandee decided to get a grip on himself and take control over family business, and as for me... I received an excellent reward for my doings.
#TEXT 13
We were late to Portobello, and Luis Ortiz had taken care of any evidence. Don Domingo is going to deal with his situation in court. I wish him luck. I am not empty-handed, though - grandee Albalate gifted me his rapier.
#TEXT 14
I didn't find the young don in marquee Albalate's house, but instead, I was met by his retainer named Ugo. He got extremely nervous when he heard the news about the attack on his master and ran straight to a commandant. I was literally turned out of the place. Fine, I can live without their famous Spanish 'hospitality.'

The Final Lesson
#TEXT 1
Today I met Gregoire Valinnie - the very nobleman who was so kind to me on my first day in this region. It feels like it was ages ago. He offered to join him in a very promising business, and I agreed. We should get to Boca de la Serpienta coast in a week, land there with a squad of fighters, find the expedition, suppress the Indian resistance, and seize the Company's goods. Sounds both risky and profitable.
#TEXT 2
Damn it! Gregoire Valinnie was killed in action. No point in continuing without my partner. Rest in peace, friend.
#TEXT 3
We didn't risk giving the decisive skirmish to the Caribs - we have too few men for this. Better to stay without plunder, yet alive. We are leaving.
#TEXT 4
Flames! Such stupidity... They must have taken away all the goods already. Gregoire Valinnie was pissed off and left my squadron...
#TEXT 5
We managed to salvage part of the cargo from the Carib lair before we were interrupted by English and Dutch vanguards. We should get away from here. Our total plunder: @<sSanl> of ironwood, @<sSilk> of ship silk, @<sRope> of ropes, and @<sOil> of resin. Heading back to Saint-Pierre, Martinique.
#TEXT 6
Victory. Bloody and pointless as it is. No way we seize the prize with such casualties. Dammit!
#TEXT 7
We are about to conclude a bargain tonight at Lamentin Bay. Soon we'll have the money, and others will have illegal cargo. My partner is a man of foresight, no doubt about that.
#TEXT 8
I am out of words here. No one can be trusted in this fucking region. I got some cash, but... Lesson learned in full. I suppose I should be grateful for this, but that scum had better never meet me again.
#TEXT 9
I can't say for sure that it was the toughest fight in my life. But I am alive, and I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach swimming in blood. I don't know how I survived this, though I have a feeling that this is only the beginning and I have just passed the point of no return. At any rate, thanks for the lesson, monsieur Gregoire. It was learned in full.
#TEXT 10
I can't say for sure that it was the toughest fight in my life. But I am alive, and I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach swimming in blood. I doubt I would have made it without Prosper. All I know is that no one would come to help me just like that in France. Lesson learned. Rest in peace, my friend. I have spared some coin for your daughter; I am sorry that I can't do more for her.
#TEXT 11
What a shame - Gregoire's vessel was sunk in battle. This is a failure.
#TEXT 12
What a shame - Gregoire's vessel was sunk in battle during our voyage back to Martinique. All the cargo is gone too.
#TEXT 13
It took too much time for me to sail to Martinique, and Gregoire left me with all the plundered cargo.

I didn't arrive at Lamentin Bay in time, and the deal was concluded without me. Gregoire's vessel is gone, and so is my share.

I can't say for sure that it was the toughest fight in my life. But I am alive, and I have both the cash and the cargo. Another beach swimming in blood. I doubt I would have made it without Prosper. All I know is that no one would come to help me just like that in France. Lesson learned.

Flying the Jolly Roger: The Amber Rush
#TEXT 1
The head of the pirate settlement La Vega, a famous baron of the Brethren, the Code Keeper Marcus Tyrex has assigned me to investigate a story of mysterious blue amber deposits told by some Spanish captain. I should either find and acquire the amber or prove the story to be nothing but a drunk boast. My money is on the latter. I should go to Santo Domingo and find a whore by the name of Gabriela Chapada. I have only three days before the information loses any value.
#TEXT 2
It took too long for me to get to Santo Domingo. No way I can find that Spanish captain now. What a shame to lose a chance to work for a famous pirate just like that....
#TEXT 3
Gabriela told me about the name of my brave military - Esberdo Cabanas. He has sailed to Havana to acquire the means to prospect the amber. Perhaps he was actually telling the truth... I should set sail for Cuba now.
#TEXT 4
It took too long for me to investigate in Havana. What a shame to lose a chance to work for a famous pirate just like that....
#TEXT 5
I was told in a harbor office that the Cantavro is on patrol, but her location is classified. I am not stupid enough to address a commandant regarding such matters. I should seek another way to get the information I need.
#TEXT 6
I have arrived in Cuba. No sign of the Cantavro. I should go to the city and investigate.
#TEXT 7
Looks like I know a way to find Captain Esberdo Cabanas! An enemy of my enemy is a potential friend of mine. I doubt that the imprisoned officer has any warm feelings for his former captain. I should pay a visit to this lover of wine and women.
#TEXT 8
Ha! That's a start! All I need is to help my good friend Lope... I should see a governor.
#TEXT 9
It's too late to help the prisoner now. No way I can not chase down the Cantavro now. What a shame.
#TEXT 10
To release Don Lope, I should gather 250 doubloons or thirty thousand pesos. Time is running out...
#TEXT 11
This is done. Costed me quite a penny, but I believe the final prize will cover my expenses. I should see my friend Lope tomorrow in his cell. I also should prepare to set sail immediately.
#TEXT 12
Esberdo Cabanas' operation is at Mosquitoes Coast. I should hurry; I have only five days or so!
#TEXT 13
I didn't make it to Mosquitoes Coast in time. This is a disaster. What a shame, no point in seeing Tyrex now.
#TEXT 14
I managed to chase down the Cantavro and her long boats yet failed to plunder even a single piece of blue amber. What a shame!
#TEXT 15
I managed to plunder several long boats, but the total gain is too miserable @<sQty> pieces. No point in seeing Tyrex with loot like this.
#TEXT 16
A plunder turned out to be fortunate; I've managed to gather @<sQty> pieces of blue amber, not to mention ordinary amber. I should go see Tyrex to boast about this.
#TEXT 17
I need to find some Rosario Gusman. According to a governor, this caballero already tried to help Don Lope Montoro out. Let's not waste time then. Don Rosario does a visiting round of the city guard's posts every day from 16 to 20 pm.

#QUEST Roger_2
Flying the Jolly Roger: The Silk Road
#TEXT 1
Tyrex must be testing the limits of my patience. Instead of hunting down trading caravans, I am to find a regular buyer for a rare commodity - ship silk. I have no clue where to begin. Anyway, first I should meet with Bald Geffrey, captain of a galleon called Snake, in Capsterville of St. Christopher.
#TEXT 2
I have wasted too much time, and Bald Geffrey must have already decided to act on his own without waiting for instructions from Tyrex. What a shame...
#TEXT 3
Why thank you, Tyrex! Smugglers offer a price Marcus won't accept. Stores are not an option. Someone must be in need of it since smugglers are clearly reselling it to someone out there. I should use my brains here - who are the main consumers of ship silk? This will help me find a buyer.
#TEXT 4
I had a talk with a shipbuilder of Capsterville, but it didn't bear any fruit, but I think I am on the right path. This shipbuilder needed ropes from Russia, but who would need silk from Lyons?
#TEXT 5
I have found my potential silk buyer. Alas, we didn't get along. Either he believes me to be a snitch, or he simply doesn't want to do business with unfamiliar people. There was a spark in his eyes when I mentioned the silk... I bet the sly dog already has a regular source of silk, and it's not a governor. Pressing the master won't do any good here; I should look for his suppliers. There is a pirate lair on Jamaica - Maroon Town. I should go there and investigate.
#TEXT 6
A bartender of Maroon Town can point me to a man who knows everything about what's going on in these waters. I must find 50 doubloons for the greedy bastard.
#TEXT 7
Looks like I need someone called Husky Billy, an ex-pirate who is now fishing around Jamaica on his old long boat. I should wait for him not far from Negril Cape. His tub is called the Fly Fish.
#TEXT 8
Billy can point me to the silk supplier, yet he asks for a new long boat plus a roll of ship silk in return. I have three days to deliver him all of this before he sails away to the open sea.
#TEXT 9
According to Husky Billy, every month between the 10th and the 15th, a brigantine called Utrecht smuggles ship silk to the head master of Port Royal's shipbuilder. I need to get rid of my competitor. I suppose I could inform the governor... let the brits do all the dirty work and making friends with them at the same time. Or, I could attempt to intercept the Utrecht at sea myself. She should be making her approach to Jamaica either from Curacao or St. Maarten. Either way, getting rid of her will make the client much more agreeable.
#TEXT 10
I didn't deliver a long boat and silk to Husky Billy in time. The pirate must be far away by now. No point in telling Tyrex about my failure.
#TEXT 10-1
It's been a week, and there is no sign of the Flying Fish. I must have missed its appearance. Shame, no need to bother Tyrex now.
#TEXT 11
So, the Utrecht is at the bottom of the sea, and so are my competitors. I should land at Portland Cove to talk with the buyers.
#TEXT 12
Damn it! The bay is empty; someone was here just recently, but they are all gone by now. I must have engaged in a fight too close to the shores. I doubt the shipbuilder can be persuaded in light of recent events. No point in seeing Tyrex now. It's a total failure.
#TEXT 13
I missed the Utrecht. I was so close yet failed to locate her at sea. 
#TEXT 14
A failure! I wasted my chance to make a deal with the worker; he took me for a patrol officer, got scared, and foolishly attacked me. Idiot. I had to kill them all. Shame, but this is over.
#TEXT 15
It's done. I managed to strike a deal with the worker. 25 doubloons for a roll. Now I should sail to St. Christopher and see Bald Geffrey.
#TEXT 16
It's been two months already. Bald Geffrey must have already sold his silk to someone else. Pity... but I think I can still deliver the information about the buyer to Tyrex. I should get to La Vega in ten days to give Tyrex some time to gather enough silk. Hope it will ease his possible anger.
#TEXT 17
All terms are long due. No point in making Tyrex nervous with my very presence.
#TEXT 18
It's been two months already, and I still have no leads on possible buyers. It's a total failure; no need to go to Tyrex at this point.
#TEXT 19
I passed the information I got from Husky Billy to the local authorities. No, I wait for them to deal with my competitors. I should see the governor by the 16th day of @<sTemp> month.
#TEXT 20
It's done. My competitor was eliminated by a military patrol. I was even rewarded with 10,000 pesos which is nice. I should see the shipbuilder; he must be more persuasive by now.
#TEXT 21
It's done. I managed to strike a deal with the shipbuilder. 25 doubloons for a roll. Now I should sail to St. Christopher and see Bald Geffrey.
#TEXT 22
Bald Geffrey was instructed - he is about to set sail to Jamaica with the first batch of ship silk from Marcus Tyrex. I should sail to La Vega.
#TEXT 23
I reported to Marcus. I should see him in thirty days to receive my poor reward. And a new assignment.
#TEXT 24
I reported to Marcus. I should see him in twenty days to receive my reward. And a new assignment.

#QUEST Roger_3
Flying the Jolly Roger: Hot Sun of Maracaibo
#TEXT 1
This time, my mission is to liberate a former privateer named Jean Picard from slavery. He's held captive on a plantation in Maracaibo. I have been granted a command over another pirate, the rather dim-witted Pelly the Cutlass, and his barquentine, the Moray, for assistance. Pelly will be awaiting my arrival at Cape Ragged Point in Barbados. Gaining entry to the plantation requires a clever ruse. Since they're undoubtedly in need of more slaves, I'll pose as a slave trader. Acquiring fifty individuals should suffice - I can either seize them at sea or visit Fadey on Guadeloupe. He's proven himself adept at acquiring whatever one desires. But these details can wait; it's time to set sail for Barbados.
#TEXT 2
I was stupid enough to waste a lot of time on my way to Barbados, it's a failure. Pity to ruin the job and set Marcus up...
#TEXT 3
Pelly the Cutlass got orders to sail to Maracaibo, drop anchor at Guajira Bay, and wait for my arrival. It will take a week for the Moray to get there. As for myself, I should go straight to the heart of the beast - a Maracaibo plantation. Jean Picard must be somewhere on it. I suppose I should pretend to be a slave trader to avoid causing any suspicions. Fifty slave heads will make it look trustworthy enough.
#TEXT 4
I was stupid enough to waste a lot of time; it's a failure. Pity to ruin the job and set Marcus up...
#TEXT 4-1
I heard rumors of pirate captain Jean Picard being killed by a guard on a plantation. My fault totally.
#TEXT 5
Here I am on the plantation, pretending to be a merchant. I should focus on finding Jean Picard now.
#TEXT 6
I've found Jean, but it is unwise to discuss his escape in the presence of guards. I should wait for the night and find Picard in one of the shacks.
#TEXT 7
The plan is straightforward and direct. Picard's men will incite a riot from within, while Pelly the Cutlass and I launch our attack from the outside. However, before the assault, I must ensure that Jean's pirates are adequately armed. We can easily acquire 30 common sabers and axes from the ship's arsenal, but the remainder must be sourced elsewhere. I'll need 30 pistols along with sufficient ammunition, up to 90 potions for our medical needs, and it wouldn't hurt to have 2 muskets with 20 charges each. I'll confer with Pelly regarding our strategy, then make my way to Guadeloupe to visit Fadey. The Muscovite is undoubtedly capable of procuring all the materials we require.
#TEXT 8
Weapons were gathered. I should think about how to deliver it secretly to the plantation. I suppose it's time I have a talk with Picard about it.
#TEXT 9
Picard is not an idiot, which makes him different from other Tyrex's pawns. The weapons will get to the plantation in boxes with goods for trade. I should offer them 500 boxes of either coffee, copra, or vanilla.
#TEXT 10
The goods exchange agreement was made, the deal will be struck tomorrow evening. I should find Picard and let him know.
#TEXT 11
I have wrecked the deal by not bringing enough goods for exchange. Shame that it all was ruined by my stupidity...
#TEXT 12
So, I am supposed to take my ship to Guajira Bay and get ready to storm the plantation with Pelly on my side before midnight.
#TEXT 13
I had screwed it all by not showing up at the rendezvous point in time.
#TEXT 14
My squad approached too close to the plantation's entrance and raised an alarm. Our rescue plan is completely ruined.
#TEXT 15
I didn't show up at the plantation in time. Our rescue plan is completely ruined...
#TEXT 16
I must have been too slow in gathering weapons for the rescue. Jean Picard and his men are gone from the plantation - either they were sold to another place or tortured to death. It's over.
#TEXT 17
We managed to organize a riot, yet Jean Picard died in the fight. It's over.
#TEXT 18
It's done! Too soon for a celebration - we have a Spanish squadron on us. I ordered Picard and Cutlass to flee on the Moray, as for me, I am about to engage the Spanish.
#TEXT 19
The enemy has a serious force. I should eliminate his flagship, cause confusion, and then flee.
#TEXT 20
A fight well fought. Heading to La Vega to see Tyrex at once.
#TEXT 21
It's done, we've fled to the jungles. Now we should head to Guajira Bay before more Spanish arrive.
#TEXT 22
I decided to refuse the services of the respected Fadey and show up at the Maracaibo plantation without the appropriate goods, they won't inspect my hold. It is risky, of course, but there is no way back. Come what may.
#TEXT 23
The advance has been paid, and tomorrow at ten o'clock I will receive the shipment of slaves I need on Capster Beach. We must not be late so as not to let Fadey down.
#TEXT 24
That's it, my money cried along with the slaves since I was late for an appointment, a bum. I'll try to show up at the Maracaibo plantation without the right product.
#TEXT 25
The deal went through, and fifty heads of black gold in my hold. Really gold, this operation cost me a lot; I'm afraid I won't even cover all my expenses. From now on, you need to think for yourself, and not enrich others. Be that as it may, I continue the operation to rescue a certain Jean Picard...
#TEXT 26
I decided not to mess with the slaves; they are definitely beyond my means now. I'll try to show up at the Maracaibo plantation without the appropriate goods, they won't inspect my hold.
#TEXT 27
My naivety played a cruel joke, and I could not portray myself as a slave trader. I'm sorry I messed things up so stupidly and let Marcus down...

#TEXT 8
The merchant was not happy about my performance. Screw this profiteer. I should go see Tyrex as we agreed to.

The merchant got his iron wood, and I got my money. Truth to be told, that damn scrooge paid coppers for such a job. Never to deal with him again.
#TEXT 10
I met Bald Geffrey at Isla Tesoro. He told me that Pasquale is in business with Tyrex. Now I see. It's a shame there is no way to punish that damn trader. With a patron like that...
#TEXT 11
I've met my old acquaintance Jean Picard who was about to point Marcus to the greed of Pasquale Lavoisier. Not the best idea, so I warned him. Picard offered me to get back what Pasquale owes me. Sounds promising. I should see him in two weeks at Gonaives Bay. Seems like Jean has an idea of how to screw the four-eyed scrooge.
#TEXT 12
Jean Picard has a plan on how to break into Pasquale Lavoisier's and Tyrex's house on La Vega. We should do everything before dawn.
#TEXT 13
I was late for a meeting with Jean. Pity.

I arrived at Gonaives Bay on foot, which made Picard mad. Jean just left without telling me about his plan. What a shame...

Robbery well done. My cut must exceed 100,000 pesos, which covers Lavoisier's debt to me.
#TEXT 16
Robbery well done. My cut must exceed 100,000 pesos, which covers Lavoisier's debt to me. Plus, I didn't allow Jean to kill a witness - a whore belonging to Tyrex. I am probably getting soft, but a woman on Isla Mona can be a benefit, he-he. She won't run away from there anyway.
#TEXT 17
We parted ways with Jean Picard at Gonaives Bay. He told me he is quitting and suggested that I should do the same. His words regarding Tyrex are somewhat true, but not now. Now I should see Marcus and report to him about Ignacio Marco.

We wasted too much time in the jungles on the road to La Vega and didn't risk doing a robbery. Jean was very upset. I should see Marcus and report to him about Ignacio Marco.

Flying the Jolly Roger: Stones of Blood and Forest
#TEXT 1
My next mission is to locate and plunder a Spanish mining village called Merida. Jean Picard will accompany me on this. Tyrex also provided me with one of his buccaneers - Luka Bayard also known as Leprechaun. I should meet him and his men in La Vega's port.
#TEXT 2
I was taken away by other matters, and now Picard and Leprechaun had left my ship. What a shame...
#TEXT 3
Our goal is Cape of Delusive Hopes, south of Maracaibo Lake. No time to waste!
#TEXT 4
Here we are in the Spanish Maine. We should find an Indian village and have a talk with their chieftain about a guide to Merida.
#TEXT 5
The chieftain is not a talkative type. Leprechaun was right - no way I am doing this without gifts.
#TEXT 6
An Indian chieftain by the name of Kumwana has promised me to gather his warriors and have a talk with them. I should see him tomorrow morning to get an answer.
#TEXT 7
Redskin chickens! Not a single soul wanted to guide me to Merida - they fear some Capongas in the jungles... This is a problem; I should talk to Leprechaun.
#TEXT 8
The plan doesn't seem very promising, but I'll give it a shot: I'll try to win them over with gifts and promises to the Indian women. Maybe one of them will convince her husband to lend us a hand... There's also another option: just putting pressure on the chief. I'll propose such an unpleasant alternative that he'll cave to find me a guide within a day. And before we leave the village, I'll need to bring Leprechaun more vials of antidote.
#TEXT 8a
I've made it clear to the chief of the natives what awaits him and the entire village if they don't find me a guide within 24 hours. He mentioned some Tagofa who might be able to lead us to Merida. Well, we'll see... I'll be back in a day. Let's see how reasonable this savage truly is.
#TEXT 9
An Indian girl named Hayami promised me to have a word with her husband, Tagofa. I should see them both after sunset.
#TEXT 10
Tagofa agreed to guide us to Merida. But his sly woman demanded payment in advance: two handguns - a dueling pistol and a trombone along with thirty charges to each. Also, a spyglass, an emerald necklace, and a golden ring with a ruby.
#TEXT 11
Tagofa has joined my unit. To reach Merida, we need six long boats. Since Lokonos don't possess decent long boats, we are going to build them. For this, it requires twenty packs of planks, ten bales of leather, and an officer to lead the building - an assigned carpenter.
#TEXT 12
It didn't take long to persuade a governor of Merida to part with all mined stones. Picard was right - it's a heavy booty. Nothing to do here now. Time to go back to our longboats.
#TEXT 13
Reckless Capongas ambushed us inside the cave. Had to put another group of theirs down.
#TEXT 14
Longboats are ready. I should break a word with Tagofa.
#TEXT 15
We were attacked by the very Capongas I have heard so much about recently. They are all dead now, and Merida is close to us.
#TEXT 16
The Spanish turned out to be way too suspicious and aggressive - they didn't think twice before charging my unit. The very last mistake in their lives... Merida's garrison is eliminated, and all of her protectors are dead. Time to break the gates.
#TEXT 17
The last Spaniards eager for a glorious death are dead now. Time to pay the governor a visit.
#TEXT 18
The booty was split fairly. My efforts to release Jean from slavery were also compensated in full. Fortunate me. Time to go to La Vega and report to Tyrex.
#TEXT 19
It took too much time for me to gather gifts for the red-skinned couple. Leprechaun, along with Jean, decided they could do better without me. Probably for the best!

The fighting with the Dutch is over. Ignasio Marco is signaling me from his polacre; looks like he wants me to go ashore to split the plunder, obviously. I am about to go there, but I will also put a watchman over the nearest hill armed with a spyglass... I need to be sure the horizon stays clear.
#TEXT 8
My precaution has served me well - this bastard Ignasio Marco works in cooperation with Castillians. It is the very same scenario that happened to Picard. A job with a partner near South Maine, then splitting the spoils, and then the Spanish squadron. If it wasn't for my watchman, they would have had me just like they had Picard. I still have time to flee... I guess.
#TEXT 9
I am not sure I should engage this Spanish squadron. I believe fleeing is the best possible option in a situation like this. It will take no less than 3000 yards between us for me to have a chance of fleeing.
#TEXT 10
I engaged in a tough battle against the Spanish heavy squadron and eliminated it. Now they know what it's like to fight a real corsair... I should hurry and see Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT 11
I've managed to flee from the Spanish squadron. I should hurry and see Tyrex as soon as possible.
#TEXT 12
El Cazador, the mighty flagship, is eliminated. Now we can try to flee - all we need is 1000 yards distance from them.

#QUEST Roger_7
Flying the Jolly Roger: Jarl's Treasures
#TEXT 1
And yet another puzzle quest from Tyrex: I should go to god-knows-where and find treasures of a recently dead pirate by the name of Wulfric Jogansen. All I have is his log. I should go to my cabin and take my time to try getting the most of this log.
#TEXT 2
I got a lead from Wulfric's ship log - the Mosquito Bay. It seems that he had been visiting it with extreme frequency. This bay leads to a couple of caves deep in the mainland. I should investigate them.
#TEXT 3
I was attacked by enraged Caribs in a grotto of Mosquitoes Bay. Looks like I've interrupted some rite they were performing around a fireplace. It never gets easy. Now I can search for the treasure in peace.
#TEXT 4
Alas, no sign of any treasures inside the grotto at Mosquitoes Bay.
#TEXT 5
I have found a chest with quite an interesting content, although I am sure it's not Red Wulf's treasure.
#TEXT 6
I've met some beggars on the exit of the cave. Looks like it was their cache I found earlier.
#TEXT 7
This lead was false. I should have expected more from Red Wolf. He was not like the rest of the unfortunate bastards who hide their belongings inside road caves. I should go to my cabin and try again.
#TEXT 8
Right, I have another lead. Wulfric had been regularly visiting some Gaspard Parmentier at Tortuga... He could be the Viking's personal banker. I should investigate.
#TEXT 9
I was told of how to find Gaspard's place. I should go there and carefully inquire about Red Wolf. It's better to pay a visit during the day. Bankers do not fancy night guests, he-he.
#TEXT 10
Gaspard Parmentier's house is close. I knocked on the door several times, and nothing happened. However, I heard someone walking inside the house. This banker is clearly hiding from men like me. Men he doesn't know. I should stand near the hatch to the dungeons and observe the entrance.
#TEXT 11
Blimey! My old friend Pelly the Cutlass has arrived at Gaspard's, and the door magically opened for him. This is insulting. I should wait for Cutlass to leave and then ask him around Gaspard. Pelly is an idiot; he will tell me everything I need to know.
#TEXT 12
Bad lead again! Gaspard Parmentier, also known as Goldenteeth, is an ordinary buyer of stolen gems and jewels. I should go to my cabin and try again.
#TEXT 13
There is a word 'gord' often written here and there. What the hell is 'gord'? I should find it out since I have no more solid leads to investigate. My friend Gino can help me in this scientific matter. Heading to Antigua.
#TEXT 14
There is a word 'gord' often written here and there. What the hell is 'gord'? I should find it out since I have no more solid leads to investigate. Heading to La Vega, I need to ask Tyrex for help in this.
#TEXT 15
So, our Wulfric the Viking had a personal secret base within the Archipelago! I bet that's where his treasure lies. I should go to my cabin and try to calculate its location using the man's ship log.
#TEXT 16
I think I have the location of the gord I am looking for. It's on an island not marked on any map. I should explore it.
#TEXT 17
I was suddenly attacked in the jungles by a horde of pirates. Must be Wulfric's men unaware of his fate. I should gather a boarding party and proceed.
#TEXT 18
This is it, I have found Wulfric's gord. Only three of his men survived, and they are in my crew now. A carpenter named Rodgar and two of his helpers. Time to search for the treasure. It must be hidden here. And hidden well.
#TEXT 19
I have found Red Wolf's treasures. Helluva money: 750,000 pesos and 900 doubloons. A third goes to Tyrex, the rest is mine by right. I will keep the secret of this island to myself. This is now my base, my gord. I can repair ships and store goods here. One day I might build and expand here.
#TEXT 20
I have my very own base from now on! Its coordinates are: 18 42' North, 72 9' West. The island is called Isla Mona. Rodgar Janssen will stay here overseeing the village and repairing my ships. Time to see Tyrex and report to him.

#QUEST Roger_8
Flying the Jolly Roger: Corrida
#TEXT 1
Marcus has ordered me to investigate the situation in Martinique. They say Ignacio Marco was seen there. I should go there and watch the bastard. I am forbidden to attack him, though - Marcus has his own plans towards him.
#TEXT 2
The Torero is on a raid of Le Francois accompanied by a frigate and a corvette. My friend must be here then. I should go to Le Francois and avoid asking anyone about Marco and his crew. My task is to watch and observe.
#TEXT 3
Ignacio Marco spent almost two hours in the residence of Jacques Barbason - the head of Le Francois. Then he headed towards a port along with two serious gentlemen who are probably captains of the other two ships. I should hurry to St. Pierre and try to pursue them further.
#TEXT 4
Ignacio Marco has already sailed away when I reached my ship. Whatever. I got some valuable information, I should tell Marcus about it.
#TEXT 5
I failed to arrive at Marcus in three weeks, and his plan was ruined. What a shame. Nevertheless, I am still in business - I should come back in a month on a single powerful ship. And never be late again.
#TEXT 6
So, I am to execute a complex plan of Marcus. First stage: I must intercept the Torero, which is heading to Philipsburg from Cuba. I'd better attack her near Sint-Maarten but not too close to the island, Barbason's pirate may notice the fight otherwise.
#TEXT 7
I have sunk the Torero in the heat of the fight. What a shame. I should go to Marcus.
#TEXT 8
I have successfully boarded the Torero yet failed to find her log. No way I am getting the information we need. What a shame. I should go to see Marcus.
#TEXT 9
I have launched a fight with the Torero too close to Sint-Maarten and had been spotted by other pirates. What a shame. I should go to see Marcus.
#TEXT 10
I have successfully boarded the Torero. Ignacio Marco didn't surrender, yet I still have his log. I should go to my cabin and investigate it.
#TEXT 11
Now I have all the information I needed. Pigeon Spyke is on his way to Tyrex. Now it's time to signal Barbason's squadron near Sint-Maarten to sail to Puerto-Rico. I should keep my distance though. 1500 yards from Philipsburg's fort will suffice.
#TEXT 12
What a shame. I have given the wrong signal to Barbason's pirates. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT 13
What a shame. I got too close to Barbason's pirates and compromised the Torero's true legend. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT 14
The signal was sent! The pirates are sailing right to Puerto-Rico, where the Spanish ambush has been set. I should hurry to intercept the gold caravan. Hope Marcus's reinforcements will be there in time.
#TEXT 15
What a shame! I've wasted too much time and failed to locate the Spanish gold caravan. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT 16
What a shame! I've totally forgotten Marcus's instructions not to add any ships besides the Torero to my squadron. Now the pirate will be chasing me for a while. I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT 17
The promised reinforcements didn't disappoint me - Marcus himself has arrived to aid me on the Red Dragon, his warship! The Spanish are gone. I should take a longboat!
#TEXT 18
Sadly, we didn't get any gold from this. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming.
#TEXT 19
Sadly, we didn't get as much gold from this as we hoped for. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming.
#TEXT 20
The plunder was good, though Tyrex had hopes for more. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming; I hope it will be bigger than this raid.
#TEXT 21
Tyrex and I were pleased with the size of our prize. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming; I hope it will be bigger than this raid.
#TEXT 22
Despite my fail, Tyrex wasn't really mad at me. I should see Marcus in three weeks on a single warship. Something big is coming; I hope it will be bigger than this raid.
#TEXT 23
I was too late - Tyrex has already gone to the raid. What a shame!
#TEXT 24
I failed to find the Torero in the high seas. Everything's lost... I should get back to Marcus.
#TEXT 25
I completely forgot about Markus' instructions - not to waste a minute and rush with all my might to Sint Maarten. Instead, I went about my business. Obviously, I will not find any Torero. I'm going back to Marcus, confessing.

#QUEST Roger_9
Flying the Jolly Roger: City of Blood Harvest
#TEXT 1
Yo-ho-ho! Me with Marcus, Bold Geffrey, Cutlass Pelly, Luke Leprechaun, and Tyrex's friend Bernard Vensan are about to raid Cartagena! There is a pile of gold waiting for us inside the city's fort, not to mention the ransom we will get from the townsfolk. A great life it is except for a hangover, ha-ha! Helluva party we had yesterday, the booze, the girls - La Vega has much to offer to Charlie Prince. I am being respected in this place! I love this life!
#TEXT 2
I am an idiot beyond measure! My exceptional navigation skills made the others abandon me!
#TEXT 3
Here is the city of Cartagena. My first task is to eliminate guard ships.
#TEXT 4
The Spanish squadron has been eliminated. I should get aboard the Red Dragon.
#TEXT 5
Tyrex and I are going to bombard Cartagena's fort. It bothers me a bit, but the Red Dragon is a fort herself.
#TEXT 6
The resistance has been terminated. Cartagena is ours! Marcus is heading to the fort for the gold, and I am ordered to get a ransom from the governor.
#TEXT 7
I made the Spanish pay even more than Marcus wanted - the ransom of 350,000 pesos is acquired. Heading to the fort.
#TEXT 8
The gold of Cartagena has been loaded on our ships. My cut is @<sGold> pieces of gold and @<sMoney> pesos. It's a rich prize, and it's a fair split... mostly. I didn't really like that Marcus split the gold without me, plus he took a fucking half of it! I agree, the lead was his, and he had the biggest ship... Never mind, I have a new order. I should head to Tortuga and put my coin to good waste there. Whores and rum, I will not disappoint you!

#QUEST Roger_10
Flying the Jolly Roger: Nemesis
#TEXT 1
Life's good! Janette's brothel will remember me for a fucking long time, ha-ha! Cost me quite a penny, but I have a new lead already: my new girlfriend, Camilla, is offering me a treasure map to a lost city of gold miners. I am sure this is not a scam since the girl was going to sell it to Marcus in the first place. She will be waiting for me in the church from 10 am till 1 pm. I should prepare 200 doubloons for her.
#TEXT 2
I have Camilla's map. I should study it and get ready for anything. I need to prepare munitions, healing potions, and antidotes in case things turn ugly.
#TEXT 3
Here it is - Caratasca Lagoon. A wild and deserted shore. Here my journey to the ruins begins.
#TEXT 4
An obstacle! I clear my way with explosives, for certain. Someone has already been here not so long ago. Heading back to my ship to get gunpowder.
#TEXT 5
Barrels filled with gunpowder are ready. I should light a fuse and get to cover.
#TEXT 5-1
My plan worked perfectly! The path is clear!
#TEXT 6
I've found the ruins. Somewhere here must be a way to the dungeons where the treasure is buried.
#TEXT 7
Camilla, this bitch! She sold the map not only to me but also to Cutlass! I would never have thought that greed could blind a man like this. We used to be good partners... Seems like the poor bastard was always envying me.
I've found the treasures, but they are protected by metal bars. I should get instruments from the ship.
#TEXT 8
Fuck!.. It hurts! Jeffrey had set me up! Greedy bastard! A second ‘friend' from the Brethren who tried to kill me today because of gold. I should get the hell out of here right now. This is so wrong. Who else is going to meet me here? Picard? We had an agreement, but nothing is certain anymore. Geffrey's men are still around, I heard the scum mentioned a musketeer unit he brought here.
#TEXT 9
Sadly, instead of Jean, I've met Luke Leprechaun here. He and his buccaneers had set an ambush upstairs. Turned out the old forester always had a grudge against me. So much for signing bandits and pirates as friends!
I do not see all of this as a game of chance. Something is in the air, I should get the hell out of here!
#TEXT 10
All of this had been orchestrated... A fucking avenger of the people set a trap for me. The man's name is don Henrico, and the worst part is that his accusations are all just and true.
I am all alone here, in this dark, creepy, and silent dungeon. I am surrounded by the dead; even rats are not present here. I still have time to find a way out before starvation kills me.
#TEXT 11
I've found a rusty key on a skeleton, and it opens a door leading downstairs. Perhaps it is a way out?
#TEXT 12
I woke up in a cold sweat. How long had I been asleep? I had terrible nightmares of Merida in flames and her dead citizens. My brother Michel was there too. He said something about a key... near me? On the stairs?
#TEXT 13
It's a miracle! I've found an old silver key on the stairs!
#TEXT 14
I've found another dungeon. It's flooded and has a very close resemblance to the entrance of Hell. It's hot in here, and there is a deep smell of sulfur around. I have no idea where to go next, plus I should worry about hot geysers bursting from the rifts.
#TEXT 15
I've reached some cave, and it has fresh and cool water to ease the pain from sulfur air and burns. The air is different here, must be the exit nearby!
#TEXT 16
I recognize this place! I've been here on my way to the ruins! Soon I will see the sea!
#TEXT 17
I did it! It's a second birth, no less... I believe I've earned such punishment. I am a monster.
Time to part my ways with Marcus Tyrex and piracy. I will meddle in their affairs again, I am sure of it, but I will never be one of them again. Pirate Charlie Prince died in the dungeons of the dead city.
I, Charles de Maure, French captain and nobleman, swear to myself and my conscience:
... I swear that no other civilian will suffer from my hand or from my subordinates
... I swear to protect women, regardless of their status and nationality
... I swear that the brilliance of gold will never again overshadow my mind
... I swear to stop the actions of any villains that I meet on the way
... I swear that between wealth and honor, I will choose honor
... I swear that in any circumstances and with any people, I will remain a worthy person.
I have a lot to do to regain my good name. But I will definitely do it. And now I have to go to St. Pierre, to Michel. Life goes on!
@<sText>
#TEXT 18
I managed to escape from the darkness of dark dungeons and boiling hell. Truly a baptism of fire. After this, it's somehow not very fitting to be Marcus' grunt. I stop working for him and go back to my brother. Life goes on, new challenges and peaks are ahead! Just let the smell of sulfur dissipate first...
