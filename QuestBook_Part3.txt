The Dutch Gambit
#TEXT 1-1
My first assignment from the vice-director of the Company is to escort Balthazar Ridderbrock. I can find him in the harbour master's office.
#TEXT 1-2
I was too slow completing my mission, and the merchant has sailed without me.
#TEXT 1-3
Balthazar Ridderbrock is now my companion. I am heading to Philipsburg.
#TEXT 1-4
I was too slow, and the merchant decided to leave me and sail alone.
#TEXT 1-5
Balthazar Ridderbrock is dead. Mission failed, and I don't want to talk to Rodenburg about it.
#TEXT 1-6
It's done. Balthazar Ridderbrock has reached Philipsburg. I was paid 5,000 pesos-Ridderbrock is an extremely generous man... Heading back to Willemstad.
#TEXT 1-7
Another mission from Lucas Rodenburg-to capture the 'Mirage'. First, I need to kill her captain, Jacob van Berg. Chinese Longway will assist me. He is the captain of the xebec Meifeng, but I was assigned to command her instead of him for a while.
#TEXT 1-8
The Meifeng and Longway are under my command. I should look for Jacob van Berg in @<sCity>, in the local tavern. Time to sail.
#TEXT 1-9
I was too slow, and Longway has left my crew. Mission completely failed.
#TEXT 1-10
I failed to capture the 'Mirage' without losing the 'Meifeng'. Longway has left my crew. It's better to stay away from Rodenburg now...
#TEXT 1-11
Jacob van Berg is eliminated. I have also found a very interesting logbook. Turns out van Berg was following someone's command. But whose? And why is he so interested in latitude 12 degrees 48'? And who is that Chinese messenger? Longway? He is the only Asian I've met here. Questions, questions, and no answers... One thing is clear-I should look for the 'Mirage' near the Boca De La Sierpe Coast.
#TEXT 1-12
I can see the 'Mirage' from here. Pirates are idle; they show no sign of suspicion. Looks like they recognize the 'Meifeng' as their own... Nice, I have the first shot.
#TEXT 1-13
I've sunk the 'Mirage'. Failure.
#TEXT 1-14
The fight was successful; the 'Mirage' was captured. I may return to Willemstad.
#TEXT 1-15
I've received my reward for capturing the 'Mirage'. Now I must do the second part of Lucas Rodenburg's plan. I must use the 'Mirage' to lure out the English captain Richard Fleetwood and eliminate him. To do that, I need to tell Fleetwood's informer that the 'Mirage' was seen not far from Dominica. John Murdock, the St. John's chemist, will tell me the name of this informer. Longway will assist me in the battle against Fleetwood and prepare an ambush at Dominica.
#TEXT 1-15_1
I was too slow, and mynheer Rodenburg has lost hope of seeing me back. As a result, I am wanted now. That was unlucky of me.
#TEXT 1-16
According to the chemist, Charlie Knippel is the informer I need. He lives not far from the seashore.
#TEXT 1-17
Knippel is so naive! It was easy to make him believe all that nonsense! Now I should sail to Dominica and wait there for Fleetwood's arrival.
#TEXT 1-18
I have reached Dominica, yet there is no sign of the 'Meifeng'. Damn Chinese, he might be late, or... I will have to do it on my own.
#TEXT 1-19
The 'Valkyrie' was sunk with Fleetwood and his logbook. Too bad, I won't get any extra reward.
#TEXT 1-20
The 'Valkyrie' was boarded, and I have found the logbook. Bastard Fleetwood had mined his vessel, and I barely escaped from her. There are a lot of interesting notes in this logbook. I am going to tear out one of its pages before giving the papers to Rodenburg. It's smart; only I will know the exact location of that island. And why is everyone so interested in finding it?
Interesting, Fleetwood believed that Rodenburg has something to do with the 'ghost ship'. Sounds like the truth; pirates of the 'Mirage' didn't attack the 'Meifeng' first. And still, Lucas ordered me to kill van Berg. But if I am wrong and Rodenburg is getting rid of evidence... hell, the man's scale is impressive! But why didn't Longway arrive to help me? It was tough out there. Too many questions and unknown names. For now.
#TEXT 1-21
I have boarded the 'Valkyrie', but I didn't find the logbook. There was no time anyway; Fleetwood had set his vessel on fire, and I barely escaped.
#TEXT 1-22
The 'Meifeng' is here, in the harbour, but still no sign of Longway himself. He didn't even sail to Dominica. That's odd...
#TEXT 1-23
Don't know why I did that, but I attacked the 'Meifeng' right at the port. Now the Dutch hate me. Perhaps, I drink too much rum...
#TEXT 1-24
Lucas paid me for my work. Besides, I was appointed to command the 'Meifeng' instead of the lost Longway. It's all great, but my ship was sunk in the fight against English privateers right in the harbour. I should go and claim my compensation. I should also visit the governor tomorrow-Rodenburg said that I am to be nominated for a state award.
#TEXT 1-25
An order from Matthias Beck and a valuable navigation instrument from Lucas Rodenburg. I think my career is moving up just fine...
#TEXT 1-26
I have to visit a girl called Abigail Shneur and convince her to marry Lucas Rodenburg. Never tried matchmaking. Well, let's give it a try...
#TEXT 1-27
So banal... It's all about money again. Is it always like that? I have to talk with Abigail's father; perhaps he will recall the island's location.
#TEXT 1-28
I met some Portuguese named Joachim Merriman. He offered me to follow him inside his house and have a talk. He is aware of Solomon's cache and promised to pay me half a million pesos for a jade skull! It seems that Solomon has hidden his treasures on the island, the location of which I have learned from Fleetwood's and van Berg's logbooks! I should go to my cabin; I will manage to locate the island using navigation instruments.

#TEXT 1-29
I have met some Portuguese named Joachim Merriman. He offered me to follow him inside his house and have a talk. He is aware of Solomon's cache and promised to pay me half a million pesos for a jade skull! It seems that Solomon has hidden his treasures on the island, the latitude of which I have learned from van Berg's logbook! But it is not enough; I won't sail a round-the-world trip to find the island. I have to talk with Lucas; after all, it is he who wants to marry Abigail, not me.
#TEXT 1-30
Here is the island I need. I should disembark there and find the grotto.
#TEXT 1-31
Solomon's coins and relic are mine. Now it's time to sail back to Willemstad. But who should get the skull? Merriman or Solomon?
#TEXT 1-32
The money was returned to Solomon. He is overjoyed, and he even granted me an amulet. Now I have to talk with Abigail.
#TEXT 1-33
Abigail said yes. I should tell Lucas the good news.
#TEXT 1-34
Lucas was pleased with my work; he paid me 50,000 pesos and gave me a valuable item.
#TEXT 1-35
I told Rodenburg that the Shneurs want money, and he came up with a plan to imitate the retrieval of Solomon's treasures. He has given me 200,000 pesos, and I must bring them to Solomon in seven to ten days.
#TEXT 1-36
I met a messenger at the port of Willemstad. I must visit Rodenburg. It's urgent.
#TEXT 1-37
Longway has offered to join my crew. I refused.
#TEXT 1-38
Longway has offered to join my crew. I agreed.
#TEXT 1-39
I have found an archive of John Murdock, or to put it correctly, Johan van Merden. It is impossible to read it though-meaningless lettering. Some cipher is needed, obviously. But where can I find one?
#TEXT 1-40
I have deciphered the archive, and it was my mistake... Lucas is... bad. Well, hell with him. He is a dangerous man and has enough power to destroy me. I will pretend that I know nothing; besides, I don't want to break the heart of beautiful Abigail. It is her choice, yet Fleetwood was an angel compared to Rodenburg. 
And I am starting to own houses. It seems I've got my first one with a dungeon underneath.
#TEXT 1-41
I have reported to Rodenburg about van Merden's elimination. Lucas is sailing back to Europe with Abigail. Well, good luck to them...
#TEXT 1-42
Rodenburg said that John Murdock, the chemist, is planning to get rid of me. That is odd; he didn't seem like a scoundrel to me. Though I have seen enough under Lucas's command, I don't want to risk it. I am heading to Antigua; I will get rid of the chemist there.
#TEXT 1-43
Looks like I am going to work as the Company's negotiation agent. Lucas Rodenburg wants me to deliver a package and money to Geraldi's branch bank in Santiago, Cuba. It is odd, but he seemed worried about my mission, yet refused to explain his fears. I should hurry; I only have fifteen days. I also have to be attentive.
#TEXT 1-44
Rodenburg's fears are coming true. I was stunned right on the street near Geraldi's bank. Now I am a prisoner inside... a house? What was that man talking about? Who the hell is he? It doesn't matter; he hasn't even chained me and left the room. I'll make him regret this mistake. There should be some kind of weapon in this room!
#TEXT 1-45
I managed to escape, and my kidnapper and his pal are both dead. My gear must be somewhere around. I should look for it. Too bad I still don't know why I was kidnapped. Hell with it! I have to take a letter from the banker and sail back to Willemstad. Santiago makes me feel uneasy...
#TEXT 1-46
Mynheer Rodenburg's generosity is impressive. There are still no clues about the Santiago situation. Perhaps, I will learn more in the future. Now I have seven days to prepare myself.
#TEXT 1-47
I was too late. Rodenburg's trust in me is ruined. Now I should expect bounty hunters...
#TEXT   1-48
As we approached Willemstad, I noticed someone had turned everything upside down in one of my cabin chests. But not a single item was taken - not even the valuables - though everything was left in disarray. It wasn't a robbery then. Could it be someone from Fleetwood's or van Merden's crews? Or perhaps just a common thief who didn't have time to finish the job? The crew didn't see anyone, but maybe the culprit escaped just in time.

#TEXT 2-1
Charlie Knippel ordered me to capture a heavy galleon loaded with silver, which is owned by the Dutch West India Company. I have to take the ship and her cargo to St. John's. The convoy is sailing from Willemstad to Philipsburg-I'd better be attentive at sea.
#TEXT 2-2
I wasn't able to find the convoy. Mission failed.
#TEXT 2-3
Damn Knippel claims that I've failed the terms of the bargain... Hell with him!
#TEXT 2-4
Charlie was pleased with my work. I should check on him tomorrow and claim my reward. Besides, Knippel told me that his commander is eager to see me.
#TEXT 2-5
Now I am acquainted with the legendary Richard Fleetwood and got my first assignment from him-I must find and eliminate the pirate who is pretending to be the 'Flying Dutchman'. I will play the role of bait and tell everyone in Bridgetown that I am a rich and stupid merchant. The pirate's agent is working somewhere in Bridgetown.
#TEXT 2-6
All major places in the town were visited, and gossip was spread. Time to fly and prepare my ship. If the agent is really operating in Bridgetown, then the fight is guaranteed.
#TEXT 2-7
I have visited a brothel and pretended to be a wood trader.
#TEXT 2-8
I've seen the governor, declined his offer to have dinner together, and told him that my ship is loaded with cacao.
#TEXT 2-9
The harbour master was told that I trade paprika.
#TEXT 2-10
I have pretended to be an idiotic merchant who is eager to sell every single cannon in order to put some extra coffee on board.
#TEXT 2-11
Everybody in the local shop is now aware that I am a rich ship-owner who is buying a lot of different goods.
#TEXT 2-12
The innkeeper was quite amused by my intentions to supply Barbados with slaves on a regular basis. Why was he? Barbados plantations are well-known, slaves are always welcome here...
#TEXT 2-13
Had a talk with the usurer concerning a big loan to buy a bunch of valuable goods.
#TEXT 2-14
I have sunk the 'Mirage'. It is a failure.
#TEXT 2-15
Now I see! Only the barman was told about the slaves. Now I understand why he was so amused. It seems that everybody else, including the governor, has nothing to do with it. No need to rush now, I have to tell Richard about the innkeeper first.
It was just the right time to kill van Berg! But who is behind him? I should ask Richard about the Asian. And why is Rodenburg so interested in some flute that was sunk at latitude 12 degrees 48'?
The 'Mirage'—that's how this bird is called! Well, it suits her... Now I have to sail to Antigua.
#TEXT 2-16
Richard told me about the island and its longitude. Now only I am aware of its true location. I should sail there at the nearest opportunity... I should visit Curacao and bring Richard his bribe-Abigail Shneur.
#TEXT 2-17
Abigail is not at home; only her crazy father is there. He told me where I might find her-the church.
#TEXT 2-18
Abigail is asking me to find her father's coins. It seems that Solomon has hidden them on the very island, the location of which I know. Van Berg and Fleetwood have been there once. I am heading to my ship's cabin-I can use my navigation instruments there and locate the island. 

*USE ACTION MENU INSIDE YOUR CABIN*
#TEXT 2-19
Jesus, I should go to church and light a candle at the nearest opportunity... It was the scariest day of my life. As soon as I approached the chest, it blew up, and I barely survived. There was also a damned monster! Now I believe in local magic. I think I should ask Richard for a pay raise. Another surprise awaited me inside the chest-the head of Gaston, the Barbados barman. He knew the latitude, there is no doubt about that. Van Berg didn't keep it a secret. But the longitude, only Fleetwood knew it! What the hell is going on? I must tell Richard about the situation and let him decide what to do next. After all, it concerns him in the first place.
#TEXT 2-20
I was too busy with my own matters, and I failed to reach Curacao in time.
#TEXT 2-21
Richard was unable to explain what is really going on. Odd. I have to sail to Barbados and see if Gaston is really dead. Then I should head to Blanca lagoon in Curacao; Charlie will be waiting for me there with coins for Abigail's father. I've got 20 days to do that.
#TEXT 2-22
Talking with the dead was creepy, yet poor Hercule was right. I don't care who will win this game-London or Amsterdam. But Richard is my friend at this moment, and Lucas is my enemy. That's the situation.
I should hurry up to see Charlie in Curacao. I have to find the chemist afterward. I suppose there is no need to tell Fleetwood about Hercules's letter.
#TEXT 2-23
Damn hilarious! Best wishes from everyone, and I am left to fight Lucas on my own. They have made me the lowest bitch in this mess. Fleetwood is a dog! Tonzag was right; I cannot trust people. I can't have friends here, only enemies.
Time to get to know van Merden better and waste Rodenburg once and for all.
#TEXT 2-24
Damn! The archive is ciphered, and I won't be able to read it without the code. I suppose that Rodenburg was talking about this dungeon. The code must be somewhere here.
It turns out that Longway and the Portuguese passed me on the island. Seems that they killed Tonzag. Perhaps they were frightened. It explains why van Merden already considered him a dead man. And Tonzag trusted him...
Looks like this map shows the location of their cache. I should check it later. Perhaps, I may find something interesting there, not just coins. There is one problem though: where is this grotto? What is the name of the island? I am sure it is located somewhere at 'their place'; they mentioned it somewhere. I should look through the documents again...
#TEXT 2-25
Lucas Rodenburg on the 'Meifeng' met me near Cayman. Of course, he was waiting there for van Merden. They are both dead now. I should search through this island for their cache. Jesus, no monsters this time, please...
#TEXT 2-26
The archive is decrypted. I was wrong, Johan didn't betray Hercule, his own curiosity did. And this Joachim Merriman. It's good that I didn't meet the wizard on Curacao. I have a feeling that we shall meet again in the future.
#TEXT 2-27
Lucas is dead, so hell with him! Richard and Abigail must have already forgotten about me, hell with them too! And I am alive, with coins in my chests and a house in my possession. I also have my very own dungeon. I am starting to love this line of work.

#TEXT 3-1
Gaston ordered me to find and eliminate some Fernando Rodriguez, a Castilian hidalgo. I should look for him in the Spanish settlements.
#TEXT 3-2
The barman told me that Fernando Rodriguez was seen on the streets.
#TEXT 3-3
The barman told me that Fernando Rodriguez is sailing within the local waters on his own brigantine.
#TEXT 3-4
I was too slow. No need to go to Gaston now...
#TEXT 3-5
Rodriguez was no match for me in fencing. Mission accomplished.
#TEXT 3-6
Rodriguez was no match for me in seamanship. Mission accomplished.
#TEXT 3-7
Rodriguez escaped from me. No chance to find him again. Mission failed. No need to go to Gaston...
#TEXT 3-8
Damn! I forgot to cut the bastard's finger, and Gaston didn't believe me. Hell with it!
#TEXT 3-9
Damn! I didn't bring items from Fernando's corpse, and Gaston refused to do business with me... Hell with it!
#TEXT 3-10
I was paid well for eliminating the target. Nice... And now I have another task. I have to sail to Antigua, to St. John's, and sneak inside Captain Fleetwood's house to steal his logbook. His place must be empty in ten days.
#TEXT 3-11
What a shame... I was too slow. No need to see Gaston again...
#TEXT 3-12
It was messy: I managed to sneak inside the house and steal the logbook, but Fleetwood's marines confronted me right on the stairs, so I had to fight them all. There were another two on the streets in front of the house; they gave me a hard time, and if it wasn't for some stranger who helped me, I would be dead. I lost consciousness due to my wounds and later found myself in St. John's drugstore. Its owner, John Murdock, told me about the situation. Now I have to leave the house at night through the dungeon beneath it. And meet the stranger.
#TEXT 3-13
It turned out that I know this stranger-Gaston, in the flesh, or to put it right, Hercule Tonzag. I didn't recognize him on the streets during the fighting. I told him that I want to help them in eliminating Captain Fleetwood. I should talk with Murdock. I have a feeling he can help me.
#TEXT 3-14
John promised to dig up some dirt on Richard Fleetwood. I should visit him in a week.
#TEXT 3-15
I was too late, and Richard Fleetwood is gone-he is sailing back to England with a military squadron. What a pity...
#TEXT 3-16
John said that Fleetwood has sent his loyal agent, Charlie Knippel, to Curacao to bring him some Jewish girl. Our Brit is in love. Obviously, I can use this bond against him. I have to intercept Charlie Knippel, who is sailing to Curacao on the 'Zeekalf' under the flag of Holland.
#TEXT 3-17
I was late, and there is no sign of Charlie and his brigantine. My plan is ruined.
#TEXT 3-18
Charlie Knippel was sunk along with his ship. My plan is ruined.
#TEXT 3-19
Charlie Knippel was too tough for me, and I had to retreat. My plan is ruined.
#TEXT 3-20
The 'Zeekalf' is taken; Charlie Knippel is captured and put inside the cargo hold. I gave orders to interrogate him. I should go downstairs and see if there are any results already.
#TEXT 3-21
Charlie was carrying a letter for Abigail Shneur. She has never seen Charlie; I can pretend to be him and take her as a hostage. It's risky but worth it. Heading to Willemstad.
#TEXT 3-22
My plan worked! Abigail agreed to sail with me to St. John's. I should see her tomorrow.
#TEXT 3-23
Abigail is aboard. Heading to Antigua.
#TEXT 3-24
John is preparing a room for Abigail. Time to take her there.
#TEXT 3-25
Now I am about to blackmail Fleetwood and demand a private meeting with him. If he has a heart, he must agree to my terms... I need a messenger. John recommended a drunkard named Jack Garrison. I can find him in the tavern.
#TEXT 3-26
The letter was given to Jack. I have to follow him.
#TEXT 3-27
The answer was received. Fleetwood agrees to my terms. Turks, Northern bay. But first, I have to talk with Murdock. Perhaps, he will give me some advice.
#TEXT 3-28
Sailing to Turks. I have to hide my ship in the Southern bay and organize an ambush. It's a nice place, with a lot of stones to hide my men behind.
#TEXT 3-29
I was too slow, and my great plan is completely ruined.
#TEXT 3-30
I was too busy with my own things and missed Fleetwood in the bay. My great plan is completely ruined. 
#TEXT 3-31
Fleetwood is smart-he brought not the money but his red coats. They didn't help him though-the man is dead. I am heading to my ship. His brig must be somewhere around; perhaps, I should take her as a prize?
#TEXT 3-32
Fleetwood's brig, the 'Valkyrie', was sailing near the island. I won the fight.
#TEXT 3-33
The ambush is set up. Time to wait for Fleetwood's arrival. He should be here soon.
#TEXT 3-34
John congratulated me and said that Tonzag is waiting for me in the dungeon. In the meantime, I should talk with Abigail.
#TEXT 3-35
Tonzag granted me excellent light armor. He also mentioned that Murdock has a new mission for me.
#TEXT 3-36
John Murdock proposed I join his fight against Lucas Rodenburg, the vice-director of the Dutch West India Company. The plan is simple: I have to capture a courier brigantine of the Company, pretend to be Fleetwood, and send a message to Rodenburg that should force him to do something stupid. 
The brigantine is called 'Hoop'; I can find her somewhere between Antigua and Saint-Christopher. She is sailing from Philipsburg to Willemstad.
#TEXT 3-37
I failed to find the brigantine. My plan is ruined.
#TEXT 3-38
I have sunk the ship. My plan is ruined.
#TEXT 3-39
The brigantine was captured and released. Her captain received a message for Rodenburg. I have to get to Willemstad to learn what reaction will follow after my message is received.
#TEXT 3-40
I have reached Willemstad. There is an interesting vessel here-a xebec named 'Meifeng'. Murdock once told me about her. A fine ship indeed. I should ask people in the tavern about her, her crew, and her owner-Lucas Rodenburg.
#TEXT 3-41
I don't know why, but I attacked the 'Meifeng' right at the port, failing my plan and ruining my relations with Holland.
#TEXT 3-42
I have sunk Peter Stuyvesant's galleon. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-43
Stuyvesant's galleon was sunk during our voyage to Curacao. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-44
I have learned a lot from the tavern folk. The local governor, Matthias Beck, was put in chains by the orders of Lucas, who claimed his position for himself. Isn't that something... It seems that my message had quite an effect here. An important fact-the 'Meifeng' is getting munitions loaded, and her crew is replaced by reckless mercs and bandits. I should intercept the ship and interrogate the Chinese captain.
#TEXT 3-45
The 'Meifeng' was captured, and Captain Longway was put inside the cargo hold. I should go downstairs and get information from him.
#TEXT 3-46
I have sunk the 'Meifeng'. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-47
I have lost the 'Meifeng', and she is gone now. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-48
The Chinese agreed to give information in exchange for his freedom. I have to land him at Cape Inaccessible of Guadeloupe.
#TEXT 3-49
This is just getting better and better! Rodenburg ordered Longway to kill Peter Stuyvesant! It is definitely a coup. They hang people for that. I have to find Stuyvesant and tell him everything. He will deal with Lucas at once. Peter's galleon will be cruising near Saint-Christopher for a week.
#TEXT 3-50
I didn't find the galleon. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-51
I was too slow sailing to Willemstad, and Peter's galleon has left me. Now I won't be able to do what I have planned.
#TEXT 3-52
Stuyvesant's galleon is now part of my squadron. I am heading to Curacao!
#TEXT 3-53
Stuyvesant arrested Rodenburg and put him in prison. My mission is finished, but I have to visit the residence tomorrow-I was promised a reward...
#TEXT 3-54
Stuyvesant rewarded me with 100,000 for killing Fleetwood and an extra 150,000 for revealing the coup. Matthias Beck presented me with an excellent navigation tool. Brother was right; I am starting to love this life.
#TEXT 3-55
I have met some Portuguese named Joachim Merriman. He promised to pay me half a million for a jade skull. Solomon, Abigail's father, was the last owner of the item. I should talk to the man after I bring his daughter back.
#TEXT 3-56
I told John about my success. I also told him about Jacob van Berg, which made the druggist really worried. I have to take Abigail back. She is in a church.
#TEXT 3-57
Had a talk with Abigail. Heading to Curacao.
#TEXT 3-58
Solomon told me only the name of the flute and the name of her captain. I should talk with the harbour master. 
#TEXT 3-59
The captain I'm seeking has gone to Trinidad.
#TEXT 3-60
Now I know the island's location. 12 degrees 48' North, 64 degrees 41' West. I should go to my cabin and make calculations there.

#TEXT 3-61
I was attacked by van Berg's pirates even before I had a chance to take coins and the skull from the cache. It seems that he has finally tracked me down. Obviously, those four were only vanguards. Time to prepare myself...
#TEXT 3-62
Van Berg's scouts are eliminated. Now I have to deal with Jacob himself; his ship is coming...
#TEXT 3-63
Van Berg is destroyed, and so is his ship. English traders won't suffer any longer from the 'Flying Dutchman'. And I can breathe freely now. I should see John and claim my reward. I also should pay Joachim a visit. Not sure what to do with Abi and Solomon-should I return their gold? Moral choices...
#TEXT 3-64
John Murdock rewarded me with his drugstore! The only term- I must take care of some scientist upstairs. I should have a talk with him later. The druggist also paid me 100,000 pesos and presented a great musket. A decent reward for my work.
#TEXT 3-65
Eh, life is unpredictable! I have been using Abigail as a hostage for weeks, I killed her beloved, and put another suitor behind bars, and now she is kissing me and her mad dad is claiming that she likes me and I should marry her. Sure, Abi is a great girl, but I don't want to lie to her till death do us part. Besides, marriage is not a part of my plans so far. Forever for her, I will be Charlie Knippel, her guardian angel and the saviour of her family. Poetry!

The Burden of The Gascon
#TEXT 1
The ways of the Lord are inscrutable!
Who could have even thought half a year ago that my brother, a Maltese knight and the hero of Barcelona-Michel de Monper, would disgrace his father's name? And I, 'the prodigal son', 'rake', and 'gigolo', will have to fix all this mess. My 'infallible' brother's mess.
And yet, here I am. Sailing to the edge of the World, far away from Paris and my Lulu. I was going to draw her as Venus Rising From the Sea, but I must admit, the sea is looking pretty different from what I was imagining before. I should consider it after my return... I hope my journey will end before Christmas, and the girl's husband will die fighting the Spanish in Flanders. He is the reason why Parisian air has become deadly dangerous for me.
I should ask about my dear brother at the Order's mission. I suppose the local governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet is aware of what is going on within his lands. However, I was warned to avoid being direct and to use caution. The direct way is not always the best way. Perhaps I should ask around...
It is good that I still have a few of Lulu's jewels and some silver coins. It should be enough to live here for a while and return as soon as I find out what the reckless Michel has done.
#TEXT 2
I was arrested as soon as I tried to ask about my brother. Jesus, I will forever remember local rats and bugs. The situation ended positively for me though-some pompous jerk visited me in prison and ordered his men to release me. He introduced himself as the governor-general of French colonies, Philippe de Poincy.
Turns out our brave Michel is completely screwed! De Poincy suspects him of every crime possible. I won't waste time; I should see my brother and let him speak for himself. What had he done if his only name can throw a man in a cage? I am heading to the underground base of the Maltese Order in Saint-Pierre.
#TEXT 3
One of the citizens recommended I talk with Abbot Benoit in the local church. My brother's name makes people nervous. It looks like he is in real trouble...
#TEXT 4
The abbot barely recognized me as Michel's brother and Henri de Monper's son. Looks like he is familiar with my father... I have to rent a room in the local tavern and come back to him the next morning-Monsieur Benoit promised to organize a meeting with the man who can help me find my brother.
#TEXT 5
Had a talk with my brother. Isn't that something! I still don't get it. Michel is accused of stealing the Order's money, and he owes a million pesos to Philippe de Poincy, the governor-general of French colonies! Impossible! And I must collect the money!
It seems my journey is going to drag out, and poor Lulu will have to find another lover. Well, it won't take long, considering her habits. And I am about to face a 'great' opportunity. Michel said that I am going to be a sailor and a captain of my own ship. Can't say that I am looking forward to it, yet I fear that I don't have a choice and I have to embrace my fate. My brother mentioned some good ship, a lugger, he called it. I should see the local shipbuilder and talk about purchasing the vessel. And where am I going to get the money?
But first, I need to get some money for the purchase. Where can I get it? Hm... my little brother suggested checking out some establishments, and talking to people... I'll start by visiting the local shop-the merchant probably has some business that needs helping.

Abbot Benoit has lent me 50,000 pesos and 100 golden doubloons for six months. Lovely!
#TEXT 5-3
My debt to Abbot Benoit has been paid off.
#TEXT 6
Done, Michel's wish is fulfilled-I am a captain! Ha, I wonder what Lulu would say seeing me walking aboard this tub! A captain... Still can't get used to it. Fine. Time to hire the crew. My brother said that the bartender might help me with that.
#TEXT 6-1
The bartender suggested I look for crewmen among the folk in his tavern.
#TEXT 7
Now I am almost a true captain-I've got my own crew! I am damn proud... Now it is time to find a proper navigator; I am unable even to leave the island. I should ask the bartender again, he has already helped me with my crew, perhaps, he will assist me with my navigator problem.
#TEXT 8
Some Folke Deluc, the navigator, was put in jail for his debts. This is the only choice I have; I should try to get the man out of prison. I am going to talk with the commandant.
#TEXT 9
I have got the debentures. Now I can go to the commandant and get my navigator out of the dungeons.
#TEXT 10
Folke Deluc is now part of my crew. I should take him to my ship and talk with him in my cabin-perhaps Folke will tell me something important.
#TEXT 11
I met a funny lad near the town gates. Walter Catcher. He said that Cesar Craig, the bartender of Le Francois, offers to use my cargo hold to deliver wine to Guadeloupe. I will be paid 10,000 pesos. It would be foolish to decline such an offer, especially in my current position. I should visit Le Francois after I equip my ship.
#TEXT 12
I have to buy 100 cannon balls, chain shots, grape shots, bombs, and 200 powder portions.
#TEXT 13
I should also buy weapons for 50 men, not less.

Provision supply is vital: 100 packs of provisions and 10 barrels of rum.
#TEXT 15
My ship is ready and fully equipped. Now I can sail to Guadeloupe, but first I should visit Le Francois for Cesar Craig's wine-10,000 pesos will be just perfect for me.
#TEXT 16
Damn! I was fooled, Cesar Craig had no intention of offering me anything. It is obvious now, someone was really eager to lure me to Le Francois. It all smells bad... I have to get to my ship as soon as possible and sail away from here.
#TEXT 17
It is all clear now. Pirates are on us. It seems those scum want my ship, so they have ambushed me far from Saint-Pierre's fort. We are alone here; I have to engage them.

I had a talk with Fadey. I haven't received any coins from him, only some rare dagger. Not an equal exchange, but it is better than nothing. I am going to see my brother back in Saint-Pierre and get further instructions.
#TEXT 19
Well, time to become a real sailor. My dear brother gave me all the time in the world to learn. Such generosity!.. Poor Lulu! She won't wait for my return... Yet, I admit, she is the last thing I care about now. Those 'adventures' my brother keeps talking about, well, they are troubling my mind. My brother is holding something back, no doubt about that. Whatever, my time will come eventually... It seems Michel considers me a worthless idiot according to his last teaching and protective talk. Hell with him! We will see, I will find a way to get better than him. We will see!
Now it is time to visit Fadey again. Time is vital; I should hurry. Let the fat man sweat a bit and find me a job. He has already screwed me once anyway, so he owes me.
#TEXT 20
My dear brother has a new task for me-to find powerful people and gain their trust. I am presented with a choice. I can work for the Dutch West India Company or find some English privateer at Antigua. I may also try to search for who knows who in Bridgetown. Just great... At least, the final decision is mine.
#TEXT 21
De Poincy is such a bastard! Michel had all the reasons to doubt his honesty. Money wasn't enough, and now I must do what my brother failed to! Michel will tell me details, just as always. My brother is in real trouble, and I have to drag him out of it. I am getting used to such business though, I have been working for people and fixing their screw-ups since I arrived here. The bright side is coins... And I like it! Just like my brother does... My life in Paris doesn't make any sense to me now. What if someone had told me that a few years ago? But enough. Time to see Michel again.
#TEXT 22
No clues from Michel, only new riddles. To eliminate Levasseur, the governor of Tortuga? Who the hell do they think I am? Head of the French army? De Poincy just loves to make people pull his chestnuts out of the fire!
Shark... Svenson... Pirates... Looks like it is time to get to know the leaders of the Brethren of the Coast.
Heading to La Vega, to see the Codekeeper Marcus Tyrex.
#TEXT 22_1
Time to take care of Michel's and de Poincy's business. Heading to Blueweld, to see Jan Svenson, a pirate baron.
#TEXT 23
At last, my brother is about to be free! But 'surprisingly', it is not getting any easier: de Poincy said that Saint-Pierre is under Spanish attack. It would be a great shame if the Spanish kill my brother after all the effort I put in to gain his freedom. Well, fighting is not a problem for me anymore, heading to Martinique now!
#TEXT 24
De Poincy appreciated my actions for the good of the Order and for his own good. I was promoted to the rank of French Navy captain. I also got a patent, a fancy uniform and, what is most important, a great military vessel. No doubt, Michel couldn't even imagine it. Eh, I wish my father could see me now!

Isn't that something! Henri Thibaut is looking for me to propose a 'well-paid' job. The sailor told me that this job includes killing Robert Martene. It seems that there is no need for Martene after Levasseur was killed... Perhaps, Thibaut has another reason. Whatever. I have only ten days to reach Tortuga.
#TEXT 26
Damn... Molly Jones wasn't a servant girl. Martene kidnapped Catherine Fox, the daughter of Colonel Fox, the head of the royal marines! Robert got scared shitless and decided to get rid of the girl. Thibaut wanted to hire me to eliminate Martene, but I refused: the girl is already dead, and I have got problems of my own. He will have to deal with his ex-partner himself.

Damn... Molly Jones wasn't a servant girl. Martene kidnapped Catherine Fox, the daughter of Colonel Fox, the head of the royal marines! Robert got scared shitless and decided to get rid of the girl.
Thibaut has offered me a quarter of a million for the head of his ex-associate-it is clear that Henri fears Colonel Fox. It is not my business any longer, but Robert Martene has killed an innocent girl, and he must get what he deserves! He will be sailing on a heavy galleon named Infanta from Caracas to Santo Domingo as part of a Spanish squadron.
#TEXT 28
I have found the Spanish squadron and boarded Martene's galleon. The bastard is eliminated, and I may return to Thibaut and claim my reward.
#TEXT 29
I have found the Spanish squadron and destroyed Martene. It was a mistake, I completely forgot that Thibaut demanded Robert's finger as proof. Damn it, I won't get any coins...

I failed to do Thibaut's mission. Too bad, the captain's path is not always lucky and clear...
#TEXT 31
Henri Thibaut has paid me what he promised. I hope it will be a good lesson for him.
#TEXT 32
It is done. Killing Levasseur wasn't easy, but I did it!
Now I can return to de Poincy. That old fox won't dare to refuse to release my dear brother. Soon I will return to Europe. Paris is waiting for me!
Paris? No feeling of happiness or joy. Michel was right... The Caribbean changed me, I am different now, I am a man. Perhaps my place is here now?
#TEXT 33
I have reached Saint-Pierre through the jungles and destroyed all Spanish forces. Time to clear the town of the invaders. God help us!
#TEXT 34
The Spanish landing party is eliminated. Now we must fight for the Maltese underground base! It is still under attack.

All intruders were destroyed. My brother's life is safe. I should immediately release him from his chamber-the time has come!

Now we must retake the fort, I need an advantage in fire support to fight the Spanish squadron. Michel is gathering forces all around the town. He will be waiting for me outside the gates.
#TEXT 37
The fort is ours! All enemies are eliminated. Now I should return to my ship and attack the Spanish squadron. Michel will provide me with fire support from the fort.
#TEXT 38
The Spanish squadron is completely destroyed. Saint-Pierre is safe now. It was a tough fight, but I did it! Now I should disembark and find Michel in the town.
#TEXT 39
Michel congratulated me, but something was very wrong with his tone. I also didn't really like how he was looking at me... or, perhaps, it is just my imagination? Whatever. I will see him tomorrow at Abbot Benoit's place. It's time for him to show me his cards...

Father Vincento is on the scene, once again. His messenger delivered a letter and assurances that the inquisitor is no threat to me. Well, let's see what His Eminence wants to tell me. I should read the letter immediately.

Father Vincento is asking to meet him in neutral territories, inside the chapel of the Willemstad cemetery. No doubt, he wants to talk about Tayasal. He must be worried about the return of Kukulcan. The final decision is mine: should I talk with His Eminence or not? I have the Mask, so I don't have any reasons to worry. Do I?
#TEXT 42
I decided to stay away from Vincento. His duplicity has blown away my trust. I don't believe that Maldonado was acting only on his own initiative. No need to search for Tayasal, Gino was right: I have the mask-no need to worry. I can destroy it any time.
#TEXT 43
Despite the fact that I did everything I had to do and that I have found Indian treasures, so I have no problems with money now-I have decided to stay here, in the Americas. I have become a real man here. And France... I will always be able to return there!

Missing Assistant

A shop owner of Saint-Pierre has asked me to find his lost employee named Gralam Lavoie. The reward is one thousand pesos. I should look for him outside the town; I was told that Gralam is definitely not in Saint-Pierre.
He is likely to be found in the pirate settlement of Le Francois in the eastern part of Martinique. Well, let's take a walk through the jungle. The merchant described the route like this: exit through the city gates, at the fork go left, then continue on the road, take a right turn, then a left passage between the rocks, and you'll reach Le Francois.
#TEXT 2
I have found Gralam Lavoie in Le Francois. It is clear that he is not eager to return to his ex-employer. Well, my work is done, I may return and claim my coins.

Now the merchant is asking me to find a new assistant for him. There are no options in Saint-Pierre, so I should look for them in Le Francois. I will be paid well if I find a proper applicant.
According to the merchant, the owner of the local tavern in Le Francois, Cesare Craig, can help me find a worker.
#TEXT 4
I had a talk with the applicants introduced to me by the innkeeper of Le Francois, and I have chosen the most suitable one. Now I should deliver him to the shop owner of Saint-Pierre. I have already invested my time and thousand pesos, so he'd better pay me in full.

Looks like it is time to master the skill of the smuggler. The Lugger Ghost will drop anchor not far from Lamentin Bay in the evening. I must find her, tell her captain a password, and get a few boxes of expensive bottled rum. Then I should sail to Le Francois. My reward is five thousand pesos. A barque will wait for me at the pier at 7 pm.

The bartender paid as agreed-five thousand pesos. As a little bonus, he gave me a spyglass, a map of Martinique, and three bottles of rum. Moreover, he suggested the idea of visiting the fort that can be accessed by going outside the city gates. Perhaps I'll check it out, but only during daylight hours. I can also visit the shipyard...

I have met some nobleman named @<sName>, and he asked me to do him an unusual favor: go to the local brothel and talk with its owner, Angelica. I have to ask her to let one of her girls, Lucille, work 'outside the house' tonight. The girl needs to be taken to the house of the nobleman, a two-story mansion with a red roof, located near the governor's residence and the store, after eleven o'clock. I am heading to the brothel near the pier.

I had a deal with Angelica. I should talk with Lucille at eleven pm. Works for me, considering my client's wish. Well, there's still time to attend to other matters. Aurora suggested a sensible idea to go to the tavern and talk to the bartender. I'll follow her advice.

Then I should take him to my client. No sailing is allowed; I must reach Le Marin Cove on foot through the jungles.

I wasn't listening to my client's instructions and sailed to the bay on my ship. No sign of pirates there; it is obvious that I have scared off the pirates and failed my task.

The pirates were not intractable. So I had to deal with them. The Spanish prisoner tried to get rid of me by taking one of their swords and fighting me, but I managed to calm him down fast enough. It is odd, but he claims that he doesn't know the usurer... Whatever, it's not my business. I should take him to Saint-Pierre. I must avoid the town guards until my prisoner is delivered.

Not sure if I will make any coins from this, but I just couldn't say no to the man whose daughter is in deadly danger. I will go with Prosper Troubale to the jungles to eliminate a band of Indians who kidnap people from Saint-Pierre.

I must deliver a load of bombs and gunpowder to the fort of Port-au-Prince on Hispaniola. My payment is five thousand pesos. But, according to LeCroix, it is only the first and the easiest part of my mission. I will receive further instructions from the commandant of the fort.

#TEXT 7_1
Caribbean in a nutshell indeed. Thank you, Fadey, quite a job you secured for me... I really need to turn a profit here, as it's been more losses than gains so far.
It appears I've been ensnared in some unsavory disputes between Spain and France. The ship is damaged, crew members dead, and time is scarce to deliver the cannons.
I could try the Jamaica route, recruit men there, and repair the ship before proceeding to the shores of Spanish Maine. However, time is tight, so I may need to proceed directly to Porto Bello...

Damn it! I was too careless. Bloody innkeeper called guards as soon as he heard the name of Jaime Silicio. Now all town is aware of my presence. I have to return to Florian Shoke empty-handed...

Well-well... Seems like Shoke's agent was caught by town guards. I must be careful, asking citizens about Alcantara seems to be risky. I need someone local, unremarkable and poor...

The local beggar was a good choice of mine. He believed in all trash I have been telling him and agreed to find out about the galleon at the shipyard. I should meet him near the shipyard at 11 pm.

What a shame. I didn't have enough coins to pay the beggar and he ran away. My presence here has become too dangerous. I have to return to Florian Shoke empty-handed...

The Pirate Saga
#TEXT 1
Let's sum up. My meeting with Svenson is delayed until I find the lost Rumba or find out what really happened to her. What do I know about this beauty? She disappeared with her schooner Rainbow loaded with redwood. She has a skilled crew, so the probability of a Spanish or pirate attack is low. Though I won't leave either of them out of account... I find the 'amorous' version the most interesting, considering her popularity among males. There are two main suspects, her most recent admirers. One of them is a pirate, Jimmy Higgins of Maroon Town, the second one is some English captain of a corvette. The ship must be military, so I won't get any information in Blueweld. My only option is to visit Higgins first. Maroon Town, Jamaica. I will also have a chance to know another pirate baron better.
Gladys' tone was so strange while she was talking about Helen's mother. Did she mean herself? Or didn't she?
#TEXT 2
Seems that I failed everything. And I had such a chance to become a friend of Svenson! Such opportunities are rare and I have lost my chance. I don't see any other ways to gain help from pirates.
Nothing to do here. I have to prepare a squadron and storm Tortuga according to all rules of military study.
#TEXT 3
Damn it! I just can't get rid of my Paris style. I have murdered the poor drunkard and lost the only clue. Where should I look for the corvette and her captain? I am not even sure that he has something to do with Helen's disappearance. I fear that I don't have much time left to find her.
But, first, I should visit Jackman. I am curious who is he looking for.
#TEXT 4
It is getting clearer now. Well done, Jimmy! I had to kill that sly before he blurted out something unnecessary. Though I admit, I feel bad for the poor idiot.
So. Captain of the Arbutus corvette is called Arthur Donovan. He is cruising not far from Antigua, probably on patrol. And he is the first suspect. He had all reasons to kidnap Rumba. She insulted and mocked him. 'Real gentleman' may not forgive such an attitude from a peasant girl, even from a beautiful one. He could know her course and a corvette can easily catch and sink a schooner loaded with redwood. I should hurry to Antigua. This bastard can do anything if I am right about him.
But, first, I should visit Jackman. I am curious who and why is he looking for, and why.

Arbutus corvette is cruising near Antigua. I don't know why, but I am sure that Rumba is there. To arms!

Donovan was too tough for me. I had to retreat. Too bad, I won't be able to find Rumba...
#TEXT 9
I have sunken the Arbutus with her captain, her crew and the poor Rumba. Eh, that was really unlucky...
#TEXT 10
I have boarded Donovan's corvette. Helen was held there as a prisoner as I have expected. That scum had thrown her inside a cargo hold to the rats, so my arrival was just in time. Now I should go to my cabin and talk with the girl.
#TEXT 11
I was right. Donovan ambushed the Rainbow. Helen didn't have a chance. Schooner was boarded, crew slaughtered, mahogany was captured and the schooner was sunk. No witnesses were left.
Smart. Donovan was out of suspicions and no one would ever remember about him if it wasn't for Mr. Higgins who provoked a scandal. If it wasn't for him, then Rumba would be feeding crabs by now.
#TEXT 12
I was too slow sailing to Blueweld and poor Rumba died of the tropical fever. That was silly...

Well, it is done. The girl did well. I hope that this will be reckoned in the other world. Now I have got a good reason to see Svenson. I hope that he is better than Jackman.

I had a meeting with Jan Svenson. He was really glad to hear about Rumba and he is ready to work with me. We had a talk about Levasseur and, I suppose, I have a real chance to get his support in this matter.
I have told Jan that Jackman is looking for some people. And... riddles and mysteries. Let's suppose that Henry the Hangman is still alive, he believes in God and angels, so his name is Enrique now. Let's suppose that he has taken Gonzales' mother's surname. Perhaps, he is hiding in Cartagena. Boarding saber 'hanged man' is quite a notable item. Yet, I doubt that Enrique Gonzales will carry it openly. Too many guesses and too few facts.
At least, Svenson will consider Levasseur's assassination. I myself have got no ideas regarding the matter. In the meantime, I should visit the McArthurs or whatever their true name is. I should also find Henry the Hangman in Cartagena.

Now I see! He is neither Enrique, nor Gonzales. I should check old Alvarez. I bet my hand that he is our Henry the Hangman.
#TEXT 151
Live and learn! He's not Enrique at all, let alone Gonzales. I need to visit old Alvarez urgently. I'd bet my hand that this is our Henry Noose.
The Cartagena priest recognized me and delivered a small sermon on what a scoundrel I used to be. He also wished that I manage to redeem at least part of my sins before facing God's judgment... Well, this city certainly remembered me.
#TEXT 16
I was a fool! I have scared shitless a peaceful Spanish citizen. My mistake...
#TEXT 17
Not Enrique I was looking for! My mistake...

That was not the right Enrique, imagine that! A little mix-up... that cost me fifteen thousand pesos. What a scoundrel! As if his business really suffered such losses from our little raid. This rascal just recognized me and decided to make a little extra via blackmail. Well, he'll pay for it, either in this world or the next...
#TEXT 172
That was not the right Enrique, imagine that! A little mix-up... and it cost the life of a Spanish officer, two soldiers, and this scoundrel's. And so it will be with anyone who dares to blackmail me!

And why so brutal?.. Where is that old boatswain? Should I visit the local lighthouse? That Alvarez is quite promising...

It turned out to be the wrong Enrique. Worse yet, this scoundrel recognized me as Charlie Prince. I had to pay a large sum of money for his silence.
Now, where to look for the old bosun? Should I visit the local lighthouse? The caretaker there named Alvarez seems quite intriguing...

It turned out to be the wrong Enrique. Worse yet, this scoundrel recognized me as Charlie Prince and called the guards. I had to temporarily retreat from the city until everything calmed down.

It turned out to be the wrong Enrique. Worse yet, this scoundrel recognized me as Charlie Prince. However, he undoubtedly used to be a pirate - He may very well still be one - which means he knows how to handle a blade. I offered him a position as a boarder, and he agreed.
Now, where to look for the old bosun? Should I visit the local lighthouse? The caretaker there named Alvarez seems quite intriguing...
#TEXT 20
Poor Hangman! Old pirate's heart didn't make it. Though Jackman won't get him either. May God watch over him.
So, here is all what I got:
1. Helen McArthur is the daughter of pirate Butcher, captain of the Neptune, who was hanged twenty years ago. Jacob Jackman was his first mate.
2. Ex-executioner of St. John's holds some knowledge of interest for me.
3. Gladys is the foster mother of Helen, but the girl might not know that.
4. Henry was a boatswain of the Neptune and he was supposed to deliver gold to Gladys for the baby.
5. He had to show Gladys a parole - the captain's ring. I wonder, will she be able to recognize it after so many years.
But first, I should talk to Svenson. I have got something to show him.
#TEXT 21
I've told everything to Jan Svenson. Everything about Henry the Hangman and his last words. But I should talk with Gladys, she might help me to clear up this story a bit. I should talk openly with her. I suppose that the captain's ring will help me in that.
#TEXT 22
I had a talk with Gladys. Mrs. McArthur didn't deny Henry's words. I also got some piece of an old map, it belonged to Helen's mother, her 'heritage'. Gladys claims that it is just an odd joke, but something is telling me that she is wrong... I suppose that I should see Jan Svenson again...
#TEXT 23
It is just getting more and more interesting. Helen McArthur is the one who succeeds the whole island! Yet, to prove her rights, we need to find another part of the map which belonged to Blaze Sharp, he is a foster son of Helen's grandfather. It is interesting that Blaze was recently murdered, no doubt that Jackman's thugs had something to do with it.
Svenson told me that Helen is eager to serve under my flag as an officer... Well, I suppose that it will be much safer for her, because I know what Jackman is capable of. I should visit the McArthurs.
#TEXT 24
Helen is my officer now. Never thought that I will command such a great girl.
Now I should wait for Svenson, who is preparing his general plan... (@<sTimer> Sharptown will be transferred to the British)
#TEXT 25
It's in the bag! New head of Brethren of the Coast will be chosen soon and unanimously. Now it's Svenson's turn. Time to tell him good news.
#TEXT 26
The end of this long story. Jan presented me an excellent amulet and five shards of the Maya's calendar. Souvenirs... I should see the new head of Brethren on Isla Tesoro. He will give me details about the assassination of Levasseur.

#QUEST LSC
The Justice Island
#TEXT parol
Current @<sText> password is '@<sParol>'.
#TEXT 1

#TEXT 2
The Justice Island is divided by spheres of influence: San Augustin and Tartarus belong to Shark Dodson and his pirates, Rivados clan owns Protector, Fury and Velasco. Narwhals control Esmeralda, San Gabriel, Phoenix and Ceres Smithy. The rest of the ships are considered neutral territories. An important note: the only Narwal ship available to everyone is the store on Esmeralda. Other ships are forbidden to visit. All Rivados ships are also available only to their own. If you want to visit any forbidden ship, you should know the weekly passwords of each clan.
#TEXT 3
Giuseppe Fazio is the man who sells passwords, he lives on Caroline. He is some sort of a mediator between the local clans. A diplomat.
#TEXT 4
Chimiset, the Rivados wizard, told me where I can find the statue I seek. The sunken ship named San Geronimo. I have to find a way to dive there in order to leave this place.
#TEXT 5
I have received sailing directions and details. Turns out that only small ships, not bigger than 4th rank, can reach the heart of the island. 
Now it is time to think about leaving this place...
#TEXT 6
It is good that I have found the White Boy, Ole Christiansen! Snake Eye was right, this warm-hearted boy has helped me a lot. Now I know that:
1. Nathaniel Hawk is really here. White Boy saved him from San Augustine's cargo hold and took him to Fernanda. That is his safe place. This ship is staying away from the others, that is why nobody has seen Nathaniel here. His health is bad and he drinks a lot. Of course, he does! I remember how I was feeling after teleportation. Nathan didn't have the Comanche potion. If I want to see Hawke, I should go to Fernanda and knock on the door. Nathaniel will open it for me.
2. Some man named Henrik can help me to reach the statue at the bottom. He lives in San Gabriel's workshop. Ole said that the man can walk at the bottom of the sea and he has even taught Narwhals to do so. Sounds idiotic but I've seen so much for the last few days... Anyway, Henrik is my only hope to reach the Kukulcan idol and to leave the island relatively safely. I should see him immediately.
#TEXT 7
Problem solved: Henrik has got a special suit to dive and to spend some time at the bottom. I have got all chances to find the Kukulcan statue. But there are certain complications, as always. The suit is broken and Mechanic needs some rare metal called 'platina' - the little silver. Of course, I agreed to help him and Vedecker gave me an example piece of the metal. I have to find ten pieces, not less. Ten pieces of 'little silver' and I will be able to find the statue.
#TEXT 8
'Little silver' was given to Vedecker and he is ready to repair the suit. I should see him again in five days, this repair is going to be difficult.
#TEXT 9
I was expecting that: now I need to find more ingots for the suit's repair. I must find @<sQty> more somewhere and the work will be done.
#TEXT 10
At last, some light at the end of the tunnel! The suit will be ready @<sText1>. I should see Mechanic at 10 a.m. I will be able to leave the island immediately, as soon as I find the statue. @<sText2>
#TEXT 11
I am ready to dive. But I have missed one thing - the statue activates at midnight. There is neither possibility to dive at night, nor sense. I won't be able to use any torch there and I won't see a thing without any source of light. But crabs will see me, no doubt. Damn it! But I have to dive, anyway. At least, I must find the idol and remember its position in order to be able to reach it in the darkness later if I will have to.
#TEXT 12
I was unspeakably lucky, I have not only found the statue, it is already activated. It is golden and there is a bright ghost star above it. I can use it immediately, or I can remember the current time and prepare better for my upcoming teleportation. @<sText> 
#TEXT 13
I have found Kukulcan among the ship's debris. It was inactive, as I expected. Now I must find out its activation time and leave the Island of Justice. @<sText> 
#TEXT 14
I should find Antonio Betancourt, he can tell me about the statue. He lives in the flute 'Pluto'.
#TEXT 15
Back to the Island. First, I have to take Danielle to her husband and, of course, visit the 'admiral'. Yes, I also should return the suit to Henrik Vedecker.
#TEXT 16
Antonio told me that the Kukulcan statue becomes active in the morning, not at night. I still don't know the time, but this is enough for me, at least I don't have to dive at night. Morning... is not that big, is it?
#TEXT 17
Jurgen Schmidt, the Narwal blacksmith can make a special blade for me. Only one and very pricey blade though. Thousand doubloons.
#TEXT 18
I have ordered a blade. It will be ready in twenty days.
#TEXT 19
I persuaded Jurgen Schmidt to make a unique broadsword 'Narwal' for Mary. Only for her. Now I must find some 'bottom iron' for it. Dodson and Jurgen said that I can find it only at the bottom of the sea.
#TEXT 20
Seems like I've found what Jurgen was looking for. This is a five-pound piece, it should be enough for making the broadsword. I may return to Schmidt.
#TEXT 21
Jurgen will make the broadsword. I should see him in two days with Mary.
#TEXT 22
Mary, Mary, she is one of a kind! She saw Rumba on my ship and, of course, she got jealous. I offered her to leave the Island with me but she rejected. She said that she will join me only after Helen leaves my crew. Well, I should end this Sharp mess, prove Helen's rights and only then return for Mary. I won't be able to get rid of Helen earlier anyway.
#TEXT 23
Damn it, that was so plain! Mary got jealous of Helen and wanted to become my officer. I failed to explain to her that I can't risk her precious life, so she started to cry, showed me the door and refused to sail with me. It was insane! Blind jealousy, so they say...
#TEXT 24
Mary, Mary, she is one of a kind! She saw Rumba on my ship and, of course, she got jealous. Fortunately, I managed to explain to her that Helen is just my partner, that is all. Mary has shown great wish to join my crew and I gladly accepted. She is the ideal woman: beautiful, smart, brave... and she loves me. To be honest, I love her too...
#TEXT 25
Dexter has got enough supplies now, he won't need anymore for the next six months.

#QUEST LSC_Drink
Bottoms Up!
#TEXT 1
Leonard Musket, the local drunkard, has offered me an interesting trick - to check some treasure chest of Giuseppe Fazio. He told me his cunning plan - I should overdrink Fazio until he hits the ground. Well, let's try...
#TEXT 2
Fazio offered me to play the 'drink it off' game himself. Mug contest between me and Giuseppe starts today at nine p.m. in the local tavern. I must be there in time or my doubloons are lost for me. I doubt that I will be able to overdrink the fat man...
#TEXT 3
Fazio was really tough. I barely overdrunk him. Leonard has the key - we should go to 'Caroline'. I am confident that our plan will work fine - Giuseppe is off until the very morning.
#TEXT 4
Fazio had all reasons to boast - the man is a bottomless barrel... I failed to overdrink him and was knocked out right at the table. My doubloons are gone and Leonard's plan is ruined. What a shame...
#TEXT 5
Getting inside 'Caroline' was easy. The key worked and I have opened the chest. All money were shared between me and Leonard.
#TEXT 6
Getting inside 'Caroline' was easy. The key worked and I have opened the chest but I wasn't able to get anything from it. Too bad that our plan failed.

#QUEST LSC_Ring
Mystery of the Santa Lucia
#TEXT 1
Richard Shambon, the ex-smuggler, has offered me a trip to the outer ring. He has found an 'untouched' pinnace and there might be some treasures. The trick is, that it is crawling with giant crabs and Shambon is not a fighter. I will deal with crabs and all loot will be shared between the two of us.
We will swim there tomorrow, at eight a.m. I should go to the 'squint deck' behind 'San Augustin'. That will be the starting point for our voyage to the outer ring.
#TEXT 2
I was too slow and Richard has gone without me. Alas, our voyage is canceled...
#TEXT 3
Here we go! Swimming to the outer ring. Richard will show me the pinnace and I will deal with crabs alone, he won't be able to help me in that. I hope, that there won't be too many of them...
#TEXT 4
The fight wasn't easy but all crabs were slaughtered. Now we may check the cargo hold.
#TEXT 5
There were more crabs on the upper deck. Had to clear it out as well. But the results are quite disappointing so far: no sign of treasures here, nobody needs copra here.
#TEXT 6
Shambon is smart and he has found a hidden cache inside the captain's cabin. 20,000 pesos, two chests filled with gold, jewels, and 25 emeralds for each of us. Not bad, though Richard was expecting more. I think that our expedition was successful.
#TEXT 7
Such a great adventure we have! Shambon is smart and he has found a hidden cache inside the captain's cabin. 20,000 pesos, two chests filled with gold, jewels, and 25 emeralds for each of us. But that is just a start... I've read in the captain's journal that there is a lot of gold inside the pinnace cargo hold. A box filled with gold! Time to find it.
#TEXT 8
We have found the gold of 'Santa Lucia'. A box of gold. Literally. Now I am facing a pleasant but tricky task - to take and hide my share before others find it.
These golden nuggets are making me feel strange... I still remember lines from the captain's journal which were showing me the tragedy of this ship. A misty image of the captain and his lover, the Indian girl Vavaya...

#QUEST SharkHunt
The Shark Hunt
#TEXT 1
Yes, of course, I was lacking desperate religious fanatics! But there is nothing I can do, I need Zachary anyway.
#TEXT 2
I understand two things after talking with Zachary: first, I have no idea left where to search for the Shark, second, Pastor will vote for Dodson only if we will find him some theosophical book 'Hammer for the Witches' written in English. There is an assumption that Shark is hiding on some 'Island of Justice' North West from Havana but it is too doubtful. We don't know if the Island even exists. But there won't be any point in the book until we find Shark. I should see Svenson, he must help me to solve this riddle.
#TEXT 3
Surprisingly, Svenson supported Zachary's idea that Shark might be on some island at North West of the Caribbean Sea. He and Pastor saw barques of smugglers or buccaneers sailing in that region before. He doesn't believe in 'Island of Justice' though (Thank God!) but he supposes that it is some sort of a hidden smuggler's hideout.
I can learn more from Jose Dios, a Spanish cartographer. I can find him in Santo Domingo.
#TEXT 4
My last hope was vain. Dios had nothing certain to tell me, only hypotheses and guesses. Ah, yes, and he has also given me notes of captain Alvarado. But there are no coordinates, no clues where to search for the mysterious Island. From the other side, why am I thinking that Shark must be there? I am in a rut again, time to see Svenson.
#TEXT 5
Here it is. Island of Justice or, to put it right, Island of Abandoned Ships. I have already done a lot of things here: made friends with Rivados clan, saved one of their kind, found Steven Dodson, killed Chad Kapper, Shark's ex-boatswain and learnt about an attempt on Dodson's life. Now I should see Dodson himself and tell him everything before something bad happens. That black Rivados told me that I can find Shark in 'San Augustin' ship. I should hurry and stay away from other ships, this place is dangerous.
#TEXT 10
I have finally found Dodson. We had a long conversation and Steven has agreed to become a head of the Brethren but we need to get out of this island first. There are no ships to sail here. Shark refused to use the Kukulcan statue, besides, there is no sign of it here. So I must solve this problem: find the idol, leave the Island and return back here on the ship. But first, I have to find plotters who are preparing an attempt on Dodson's life. He will give me sailing directions after I deal with this mess.
I suppose, I should start by visiting the headquarters of Rivados and talking again with Chimiset.
#TEXT 11
Chimiset said that they may try to shoot Shark when he will be doing his favorite walk around the rear gallery of 'San Augustine'. He may be shot from the platform of 'Furie' or from the bowsprit of 'Santa Florentine'. A long-range and accurate musket is needed to perform such a shot. Chimiset has never seen any weapon like this on the island but it doesn't mean that it couldn't be found here. I should ask locals, perhaps someone heard about such a musket. It will serve as a clue to the suspect killer.
#TEXT 12
Merchant told me that a long-range and accurate musket exists on the island and it belongs to some Adolf Barbier. Interesting, but some Red Mary and Cyclops Marcello are also interested in this musket. Barbier is often seen in the tavern. Let's talk with the man...
#TEXT 13
I didn't find Adolf in the tavern, but I learnt the name of the last man who has seen Barbier. Giuseppe Fazio, he lives on 'Caroline'. Time to pay him a visit.
Sancho told me interesting things: both of them have reasons to hate Shark, Red Mary supposes that he has killed her lover, Alan Milrow, and Marcello hates every pirate. Besides, Cyclops was a royal huntsman, he must be an excellent shooter. Some of them is a sniper I seek. Now I should find Barbier and his rifle...
#TEXT 14
Looks like it is getting clearer now. Adolf Barbier became rich one day, redeemed his rifle and bought a new cabin on 'Santa Florentine'. Chimiset was right, it is an excellent place to shoot from. It means that my guesses about Red Mary and Cyclops were wrong... Well, I should go and shake the truth out of this Adolf..
#TEXT 15
Kind Adolfo wasn't really kind. He called me a 'psycho' after I tried to accuse him of plotting against the admiral and attacked me. Had to calm him down... Now I should check his corpse and his cabin, perhaps, I will find something interesting. The rifle must be somewhere here too.
#TEXT 16
There was a key and an interesting note on the Adolf's corpse. He wasn't acting on his own. It all got complicated again... It is possible that Adolf wasn't a killer at all. But who is then? The only way to find it out - is to hide the corpse, stay here and wait until our mysterious visitors will come to see Adolf at midnight for his key.
#TEXT 17
Red Mary and Marcello Cyclops were Barbier's partners in crime. Both of them. We didn't have a chance to talk, Mary had immediately realized who am I and attacked me. I had to kill them. I feel bad for the girl, she was fooled by Chad and died because of his intrigues. He just used her temper and feelings.
Time for corpse checking again - perhaps, I will find more evidence.
#TEXT 18
I have found a letter from Chad Kapper on Mary's body. It is all clear now. I may go to Shark and report him about my success. The plot is revealed and the attempt is prevented.
#TEXT 19
I have finally found Dodson. We had a long conversation and Steven has agreed to become a head of the Brethren but we need to get out of this island first. There are no ships to sail here. Shark refused to use the Kukulcan statue, besides, there is no sign of it here. So I must solve this problem: find the idol, leave the Island and return back here on the ship. In the meantime, I should go to prison on 'Tartarus' and talk with some black wizard named Chimiset, he may help me with my problem.
#TEXT 20
Chimiset told me that Shark is in danger, his own people are preparing an attempt on his life. He also said that Chad Kapper can not be trusted. Well, I should see Dodson and tell him everything.
#TEXT 21
I've told Shark what I learnt from Chimiset. Of course, he didn't really like the news but he wasn't looking really upset. Fine, I should explore the Island, get to know its inhabitants, perhaps, I will find out something about the idol of Kukulcan.
#TEXT 22
Steve Dodson asked me to help him - Giuseppe Fazio, the local mediator, appointed a meeting for him at midnight in his cabin on 'Caroline'. Shark thinks that it smells bad and he is probably right due to the recent events. Me and Steven will meet at midnight on 'San Augustine' upper deck.
#TEXT 23
As I feared - it was a trap. As soon as me and Steven entered the cabin, we were attacked by Chad Kapper and some girl in a red coat. There were also a few Narwal soldiers with them. Steven died in this unequal fight. Damn it, that is bad! And who will rule the Brethren? Jan mentioned that we may try to use Tyrex... We have got no choice now, Tyrex then. Well, I should talk with Layton Dexter tomorrow morning, no doubt, he will be elected to be an admiral.
#TEXT 24
As I feared - it was a trap. As soon as me and Steven entered the cabin, we were attacked by Chad Kapper and some girl in a red coat. There were also a few Narwal soldiers with them. We barely made it and killed all of the attackers.
Chad's treachery and Narwal's meanness have made Steven enraged. I fear, that Narwhals are in trouble now - Shark owns most of the provision supplies. Yet, I suppose, that this plot is not that simple. I should conduct a search of Fazio's cabin, I may find some clues to fill the gaps.
#TEXT 25
Conversations with shamans and spirits have their own advantages - it seems that I have mastered a sixth sense. I've found an interesting letter inside Fazio's chest. It seems, that managed to write it and hide it after he was forced to write an invitation to Steven which led us in a trap. Turned out that all of that was planned only by Chad, Mary and a few Narwhals. Hm. I should see Donald Greenspen, the head of Narwhals. We have to talk. His residence is on 'Esmeralda'.
#TEXT 26
Donald assures me that his clan has nothing to do with an attempt on Dodson's life. Chad and Mary were acting on their own initiative. Narwhals from 'Caroline' were under Mary's command. Donald is ready to offer his apologies to Shark, especially after Narwhals have learned that he didn't kill their leader, Alan Milrow. I should go to Steven and persuade him to avoid spoiling difficult relations with Narwhals.
#TEXT 27
It's done. The conflict is settled, Steven is even ready to make peace with the clan. Now I should go to Donald Greenspen and tell him about Dodson's decision.
#TEXT 28
Shark is dead, but life is moving on. Layton Dexter is the admiral now. I have to find Nathaniel Hawk and the Kukulcan portal - no need to stay here any longer.
#TEXT 29
I have managed to leave that wet cargo hold and started to swim around this island of abandoned ships, looking for a place to climb up. At last, I have found an entry inside some old flute, I was fortunate and the door wasn't closed. There was a fight inside, some girl in the red coat was standing against two big guys whose faces were covered by black headscarves. I interfered in their fight, but, despite of my help, the poor girl was killed. I should check her dead body, perhaps, I will learn a reason why she died.
#TEXT 30
There was a very interesting note. Her name was Mary and she was murdered because she refused to be a lover of some Chad Kapper and to participate in the assassination of... isn't that something! Shark Dodson! It means that Steve Dodson, the man I seek, is somewhere here... I must find him as soon as possible, before Chad Kapper does it first.

I have managed to leave that wet cargo hold and started to swim around this island of abandoned ships, looking for a place to climb up. At last, I have found an entry inside some old flute, I was fortunate and the door wasn't closed. There was a fight inside, some girl in a red coat was standing against two big guys whose faces were covered by black headscarves. I interfered in their fight and together we have made it. I got acquainted with the girl. Her name is Mary Casper, she is also known as Red Mary.
I have found Shark Dodson against all expectations, turned out that he is here, on this island. His residence is on 'San Augustin'. I must go there immediately, I must warn him about the attempt on his life and treachery of Chad Kapper.
Mary... What a wonderful creation. A unique combination of beauty, femininity, bravery, smartness... She is quite charming, despite her straightforwardness and some sort of harshness. Even Rumba is faded compared to her. Damn it, what the hell am I writing here, falling in love is not what I need right now!
#TEXT 32
As I expected, Steven has gone insane when I told him about Kapper's treachery. But it didn't stop him from quickly making a smart plan of Chad's elimination by the hands of Rivados clan. I will play the role of diplomat. Well, time to see the leader of Rivados, Black Eddie.
#TEXT 33
Rivados have screwed us after all, they managed to rescue their own but failed to kill Chad. Too bad... We are all in danger until this scum is dead. It would be different if Rivados let me go with them. But what is done, is done. I should go and report to Dodson. Eddie has brought me some notes written by Kapper. I should read them, perhaps, I will learn something useful.
#TEXT 34
Shark wasn't happy about Chad's lucky escape. Of course, he wasn't! Well, I have to track him down while Dexter is ordering his men to be attentive. Let's start with Mary, I should show her Chad's letters, she might give me some clues.
#TEXT 35
Mary wasn't helpful, but she told me something. Chad was going to get a barrel of Irish whiskey from Axel Yost, the merchant. That is strange, Mary said that Chad drinks only rum. Marcello Cyclops, the sniper, is also a mystery. I should talk with Axel, he is my only clue.
Damn it, once again, I realize that I am thinking about Mary instead of Chad and how to find him. Dear Mary? That is how I called her? I don't like it...
#TEXT 36
It is true, Kapper has really bought a barrel of rare Irish whiskey from Axel. He was also wondering about arsenic for pesky rats on 'Tartarus'. It is suspicious, why should he care about rats now? He won't get inside 'Tartarus' until Shark is dead. Axel didn't have any arsenic so he sent Chad to Sancho Carpentero, he always fights with rats in his tavern. I should go to Sancho immediately!
#TEXT 37
Kapper didn't dare to show himself in the tavern, it is too close to 'San Augustin'. But on the other hand, Marcello Cyclops has bought arsenic. Whiskey and arsenic. I am starting to realize the plan of these two scums...
#TEXT 38
I have found Barbier's corpse and some Narwal standing upon it in 'Santa Florentina'. He attacked me immediately. These bastards are getting too insolent. There was a note written by Adolf to Cyclops. He tried to blackmail Marcello and now we see the results. False path again, no sign of Cyclops and Chad... Galleon 'Eva' is my last option, it is the only place where they can hide. Sounds silly...
#TEXT 39
Chad Kapper is eliminated and so are all of his Narwal companions. There was no Cyclops among them, all of them had two eyes. I was right, they have poisoned whiskey and delivered it to Shark. I should hurry, perhaps, there is still time...

It is just getting impossible from hour to hour! Damn Chad has ordered Cyclops to sneak inside Mary's cabin and to kill her. He knows the way to bypass all the locks! Fazio said that he might already be there. I won't swim to her cabin in time, the only way is to run through Narwhal territories. I know the password, it is '@<sParol>'. I must hurry, I must save her! Heading to 'Ceres Smithy'.

I've reached 'Ceres Smithy' in time - Cyclops was sneaking through the cargo hold. I found him and killed him. It is alright now, there are all dead, no more threats from Chad and his people.

I am such an idiot! I've made it in time, Cyclops was sneaking through the cargo hold. I've found him and we started a fight. Mary, that reckless girl, engaged the fight and died. Nonsense! Why didn't I protect her? I've never suffered like this before...

#QUEST BaronReturn
The Return of the Baron
#TEXT 1
Those bandits from the abandoned mine are quite interesting. Something is very wrong here. Perhaps, Danielle, the wife of Nathaniel, has managed to learn something specific? But where should I look for her?
#TEXT 2
Isn't that something! Danielle was waiting for me right in front of Svenson's residence. Turned out that she had been stalking Jan for a long time, heard our conversation and decided to interfere. I accepted her proposal of partnership. Dannie Hawk will accompany me until we find her husband.
Danielle had been searching for her husband independently for a while and she has got some results. Some Miskito shaman, named Snake Eye, said that Hawk has survived and was captured and escaped. Nobody has seen the man since then. What did shaman mean by saying that Hawk could be 'eaten by Kukulcan'?
I have to see this shaman and find answers for all questions I have. He lives in an Indian village in the depth of Main, west of Amatique Bay.
#TEXT 3
Snake Eye told me a lot, but I failed to understand even more. I mean, that it is out of my understanding... Turns out, that this stone statue can move people through time and distance. This Indian must be mad, but he doesn't look that way and something is telling me that he is right, yet my mind still can't accept it. If I want to find Hawk, I must do what he did - to let the statue 'eat me'. As far as I understood, this 'eating' thing is quite dangerous, so first of all, I must get some special Comanche potions, they can heal people even from the worst diseases. Snake Eye is ready to give me three potions in exchange for three amulets: @<sItem1>, @<sItem2>, @<sItem3>.
#TEXT 4
I have got all three potions. The scariest thing ahead: I have to come to the statue at midnight and let it eat me. To be honest, I fear that it won't work. Whatever, let's just hope, it is the only thing we have got. Enough of reasoning, time to see the statue.
#TEXT 5
Impossible! As soon as I've touched the Kukulcan statue, all things went insane, I was thrown inside some half-sunken cargo hold and attacked by a monster - a terrible giant crab. I had to fight it.
It seems that this is the island of ships, which Snake Eye was talking about. Time to get out of the cargo hold and explore the island.
#TEXT 6
I was met by four brave thugs with muskets as soon as I've left the cargo hold. Resistance was futile, so I had to surrender and let them clear up my pockets. It seems that they thought that I am just a thief. Reasoning those idiots was pointless and now I am being taken to their boss named Chad. Perhaps, he will be more manageable?
#TEXT 7
The underwater statue has thrown me away from the Island of Justice right to some Caribs village. Thank God, my suit made them think that I am some sort of a great warrior's spirit. They have decided to offer me to... guess who? To another Kukulcan statue! It is standing near their village. The chief said that it activates in the evening. I have to wait and go through the damn portal again, far away from these bloodthirsty redskins.
#TEXT 8
Indeed, the statue turns 'alive' in the evening. I have got no choice - I have to offer myself to Kukulcan for the third time. I wonder where it will spit me out now?
#TEXT 9
At last, my teleportation marathon is ended. Kukulcan has spit me back to the place where I started my journey. It means that statues teleport things in a circle. Danielle met me, she was waiting for me all the time. I've told her about Nathaniel.
Now I should sail to Blueweld, talk with Svenson, prepare an expedition and return to the Island. I need a vessel not larger than rank four. I should also buy as many provisions as possible.
#TEXT 10
I've found Nathaniel Hawk on the flute 'Fernanda'. I admit, I imagined the pirate baron differently, but I can understand him, I know that feeling after teleportation. Poor Nathan is feeling really bad: drinking rum, low spirit and giving way to memories. I should hurry and return here on a ship, I fear that he won't last long or will ruin himself with drinking. I believe that Danielle will heal his spirit and Snake Eye will heal his body.
#TEXT 11
Danielle's appearance made a great impact on Nathaniel - he even became a bit younger. Danielle will take him to the ship and then we will go to Snake Eye. He will heal the man.
Danielle and Nathaniel... They have managed to save their love for so many years! I can only envy them.
#TEXT 12
I've told Snake Eye about my trip. He was listening carefully, and supposed that statues are broken because there is no sense in moving people in circles. Shaman said that all statues must send their victims to one special place... Though I don't want to think about it. I will never come close to these statues.
#TEXT 13
Nathaniel was brought to Snake Eye for treatment. Shaman promised to restore Hawk. Well, I will hope. Danielle asked to stay in my crew for a while, until we will find and kill the blood enemy of Hawks - Jacob Jackman.

Such an interesting letter! Well, working for Barbazon wasn't for nothing!
It seems that Jacob Jackman himself wrote this letter. He and his late brother had great plans. I hope that Jacob will join his brother soon. Whoever his boos is, but he is much smarter if he bet on English. Jackman was fool to play with barons alone.
Looks like Jacob is planning a trap for Tyrex.  As far as I understood, the ship is loaded with gunpowder and it will be blown up by snipers from the shore as soon as Marcus gets there.
Those who survived, will be killed by Vampire's and Scum's men. And by mine men, of course. My name is David Fackman also known as the Knave. I need his polacre 'Marlin'. I will use it to meet Jackman's men and if, I lucky, the man himself. Perhaps, I should capture Scum's ship, there must be some interesting documents. I won't worry Tyrex now, it seems that he is a quick-tempered man, I don't want him to spoil everything.
#TEXT   9
Polacre 'Marlin' is captured. It should help me a lot, because I will be able to approach Jackman's ship closer without alerting them. Time to prepare my ship and sail to Turks, I have to spoil Jackman's plans.

'Marlin' was sunken during a fight. Damn it, that is poor! I won't be able to approach Jackman's ship unnoticed. Well, perhaps I should find another polacre, rename it and try to fool them...

I am sailing near Turks but there is no sign of my enemy... Strange, perhaps my squadron has frightened them. I should sail here alone, on a polacre named 'Marlin' - only then I will have a chance to end this gang.
#TEXT   12
Well-well... I can see the brigantine, it is standing in a gulf, sales are unset. No sign of corvette 'Devilfish' and frigate 'Merciless'. I don't like this calm before the storm..

The pirate ambush is eliminated, they were supposed to blow the ship up. It is safe now, I may go aboard and see what is going on there.
#TEXT   14
Damn it! Here they are... I can see frigate and corvette at the other side of the island, North Bay. I have to destroy them all and board Scum's corvette, I might find there useful papers. They know 'Marlin', so, I suppose, they won't shoot first. But I must visit 'Separator', perhaps someone needs help there.
#TEXT   15
I have freed Bernard Vensan, a captain of 'Separator',  and ordered him to sail away from Turks, his ship won't help me in the upcoming fight anyway. Now I have to round the island and destroy Vampire and Scum. Damn, a single polacre versus corvette and frigate?.. But there is a way to get a rid of the frigate - my smart girl @<sName>  proposed a wise tactical move. Pirates don't suspect 'Marlin', so we can approach them and throw a big barrel of gunpowder near the frigate, light the fuse and sail away. That's a plan. I will try to blow the frigate and board the corvette... I wish that they won't realize who we really are.
#TEXT   16

#TEXT   19

I have found Jackman. A polacre versus frigate - this is unfair, especially considering my intentions to board 'Centurio'. The ship is crawling with mercs and I don't like their ferocious faces. There are no newbie's in Jackman's crew, that's for sure. Well, let's hope that 'Marlin' will let us to approach them close enough. I am sure that fooling Jackman won't be easy... @<sText>
#TEXT   21
Yeah, I am lucky to have such a smart girl in my crew... Her idea is complicated, but I am going to try it. We have to approach as close as possible to them and throw few barrels, filled with gunpowder and grapeshot, on their upper deck. It will work only if pirates won't reveal our true intentions. Eh, I wish I had more secrecy today...
#TEXT   22
Damn it, we did it! Our fougasses have cleared out every living from the deck and ruined their morale. Now it's time to board them!
#TEXT   23
I have sunken 'Centurio' with all evidences and my hopes to fulfill Svenson's mission.
#TEXT   24
The tough fight is behind. 'Centurio' is taken and returned back to Danielle. Jackman is eliminated. His chests was filled by evidences:
- an Indian shard which belongs to Hawk, it proves that Jackman was the one who organized an attack on Nathaniel
- a note with password for bandits from the abandoned mine, it is another evidence explains why Hawk's people were ambushed and how Jackman was able to solve problems with bandits that fast.
- half of the map which was a property of Blaze Sharp, now all suspicions will be taken away from Shark! And Jackman was insisting that he didn't kill Blaze... I have got both parts of the map and Helen will get her island
Moreover, I have found an English version of 'Hammer for the Witches', looks like Jackman's agents work faster than Svenson's men... 
And now it is time to visit all three barons: Tyrex, Barbazon and Zachary Marlow. I am confident about Marlow and Tyrex, but Barbazon requires some pressure...
I am curious what are they guarding at that abandoned mine and who actually owns it? It seems that Jackman was some sort of an administer there. I think that Svenson will be interested finding out the truth.

Baker is smart, that's for sure. I have been always suspecting that loving exact sciences won't do any good. I wonder what my brother would say...
Helen has got a history. Turns out that her father, Butcher, is alive. That is what Hangman was talking about! He knew that for all twenty years... He's called Lawrence Beltrop now. The Lawrence Beltrop from Port Royale, Jackman's 'master'. Interesting. So, what value holds this information for me?
I suppose, the only value holds a longitude under bloodthirsty Jessica's poems. I bet that it is the coordinates  of the island where Helens mother died. It is a pity that latitude is unreadable. The island must a creepy place! I won't take the girl there, even though I've promised her. Who knows, what awaits on that damn island.
The tooth was belonging to Shark, S.D. - this means Steven Dodson. I suppose, I should visit new head of pirates on Isla Tesoro. I hope that he will be able to clear up something for me. Especially concerning the Mask and Jessica.

It is good to have a lot of friends! My brother was right, connections and relations can solve everything. Now I know the latitude. 21 32' North. It took me a week to do what Blaze Sharp was doing for twenty years -  I have found a place where Beatrice died. I have to find a grave of Helen's mother. Let's hope that her corpse wasn't looted and I will be able to find some papers for lawyer. I don't like being tomb raider but I don't have a choice.
Perhaps, I could talk to Svenson first, some extra information about Jessica, the Beatrice's murderer could be helpful.

I have found the island. I don't like this place, though I don't see anything threatening here. Obviously, somebody had been living here before - old ruins of a small house and suspension bridge testify that this island was inhabited once. But I don't understand how anyone could choose such place for living.
I have found an old grave here. I don't need to dig, somebody did it before. It's empty, there is also a coffin with remains standing near it. No papers, no documents, not a single ring or cross. Perhaps, my voyage was for nothing... Though something is telling me that this deserted reef is hiding what I'm seeking. A key to prove Helen's origins.
I've spent here only a few hours, but this place makes me feel strange. Fear, ghastly animal fear. If it wasn't for Helen, I would have already run away from here. The grave is making me feel cold, despite of the heat. Skeletons don't bright up the picture around me. In addition, I can fight with the feeling that I am been watched, by someone invisible. I am sure that I am not alone here...

Jessica Rose, the killer of Beatrice, she died twenty years ago. This is the most fearsome creature I've ever seen in my nightmares. And she attacked me.
The most horrible fight in my life. I had to fight with an army of undead and Jessica has almost ruined me with her curses. I barely dealt with Jessica and her 'minions'.
I have found what I was looking for on the second time dead corpse of Jess. A letter written by Beatrice Sharp to her brother Blaze. Now I have got all evidences to prove Helen's origins.
Jess died and that creepy atmosphere has gone. I should bury her remains, read some prayers, do a sermon, perhaps, this will help the poor soul to find peace. And I have to think about healing myself, Jess has turned me in disabled person. I suppose that only holy fathers can help me in this matter...

Jessica begged for my mercy and I agreed to listen to her. It wasn't easy to stop my hand from ending her 'life' but I recalled her sad story.
Jess asked me to take her to Jamaica, and to land her at Portland Cove at night. She is going to pay a visit to her ex captain, lover and killer - Lawrence Beltrop. Beltrop is my enemy and their meeting won't likely be peaceful, so I agreed. Besides, Jess promised to give me what I'm seeking. She also promised to explain me how to heal myself and take off her curses which made me disabled. Though she sworn that she woldn't harm my crew and Helen, I suppose that the daughter of Beatrice should live in my cabin until we reach Jamaica. I will be watching over her.

I also received a legendary flame-bladed sword. I should sail to Bridgetown, see the local priest and ask for his help in the name of Jessica. I also should prepare twenty candles.
Obviously, killing Beltrop was some sacred Jessica's vow. It was keeping her in the world of living for twenty years. It is expired now, so I did what she asked. I buried her body at Portland Bay, put a simple cross above it and read a prayer. I hope that her poor and suffering soul will find peace at last.

#QUEST SharkGoldFleet
Duo with the Shark
#TEXT   1
The Shark has an interesting idea. He claims that one of the ships for the "Golden Fleet" is equipped in Caracas and carries gold from there from the Spanish mine Los Teques. This ship will leave at first either alone or with a small escort, but at about the longitude of the Gulf of Maracaibo it should be met by a Spanish military squadron and further escorted to Porto Bello. The exact date, the name of the ship and the coordinates of the meeting place should be sent by courier ship, or by a well-turned reliable merchant or privateer, but definitely within the next three weeks, so I need to be on time. Then, in the same way, an answer-confirmation should come from Porto Bello that the ship will be met.
And that merchant will be me.
'Fortune' is the best suited for this task: the ship is powerful, fast, built by the Spaniards. Now, for the sake of persuasiveness, I need to purchase a license from the Dutch West India Company for six months, so that there is definitely no suspicion. Then you need to buy in Caracas ... say, 300 units of coffee and cocoa - I heard they are cheap there, but in Porto Bello, on the contrary, they are expensive. In addition, it is worth buying it there so that everyone around can see it. Well, then you need to casually ask the head of the local port authority if he needs to take something or transfer it to Porto Bello for a fee.
#TEXT 2

Damn! I was too busy and late to Caracas. The courier lugger had already left for Porto Bello with the letter. But Steven warned me about the timing! But nothing... All is not lost yet. I'm going to chase the courier! I must by all means intercept him and deliver the letter to the Port Authority of Porto Bello myself.
#TEXT 6
This is a failure. I sank a courier lugger with correspondence bound for Porto Bello. Now the details of the ship with the loot are no longer available.

"Excellent! I intercepted the courier lugger, which was going to Porto Bello, and took the documents I needed. Now it's just a matter of delivering them to the recipient. But I need to hurry. I think I have ten days.
And why did Shark come up with such a plan to pass me off as a Spanish merchant? Since we knew that the courier had to leave within three weeks, we could just wait for him and intercept ... Which, in fact, I did.
#TEXT 9
Damn! I forgot that I need to deliver documents to the head of the Port Authority in Porto Bello. I'm afraid it makes no sense to go there now: most likely, everyone is already aware of the missing courier. You can forget about the case.
#TEXT 10
Damn! The head of the Port Authority of Caracas, it turns out, knows all the local merchants with squadrons by sight, but, of course, I don't. He didn't trust me with a courier job. Steven told me not to take a squadron with me - but I, a fool, did not listen. But nothing... All is not lost yet. I think in the next couple of days these documents will still be sent by courier lugger. I'll wait at sea. I must by all means intercept him and deliver the letter to the Port Authority of Porto Bello myself.
#TEXT 11
Damn! I didn't come to Caracas on the 'Fortune', and the local port authority decided that my ship was not suitable for him. Steven told me to take 'Fortune'... But nothing... All is not lost yet.

I must by all means intercept him and deliver the letter to the Port Authority of Porto Bello myself.

Damn! I didn't get a West-India's license for six months, and the head of the port authority in Caracas did not believe that I was an honest trader.

#TEXT 14
Got it! I managed to convince the head of the Port Authority of Caracas that I was an honest and reliable merchant going to Porto Bello, and he instructed me to take his colleague the sealed correspondence. I'm willing to bet that it's about the ship that Shark and I are after. But you cannot open the letter, otherwise Porto Bello will not write a response confirmation. It will be necessary to come up with something ... Fine, we'll figure it out on the spot. Now - heading for Porto Bello! I have ten days, then the letter will be irrelevant.
And we must not forget to sell the purchased goods there: in the end, you can also earn a good profit on this. And it's time for me to release the holds, hehe.
#TEXT 15
Thousand of devils! I did not have time to deliver a letter to the head of the Port Authority of Porto Bello. Obviously, now it will not be possible to send the ship at the right time, and the date will be agreed anew. Of course, after failing the second time, no one will give me such a task. You can forget about the case.
#TEXT 16
Anchor down my throat! It turns out that the name of the courier was indicated in the letter. Which, of course, I did not know and therefore could not introduce myself to them. The head of the port authority of Porto Bello suspected something was wrong and called the guards. Fortunately, he already gave me a reply letter, so the ship with booty from the port of Caracas will leave if only I bring it in time. I was given a deadline of ten days - I think during this time I need to be in time before the news about what happened here reached there before me.
But there is also a pleasant moment: this bureaucrat was so excited that he himself accidentally blabbed about the date and coordinates of the meeting of the ship and the military squadron. I memorized them: @<date>, 12' 50'' and 69' 55''.
#TEXT 17
I brought a letter to the head of the Port Authority of Porto Bello. He checked my name and what was written there, and then gave me the answer for the Port Authority of Caracas. It must also be delivered within ten days.
I just don't know the details of the letter. No coordinates, no date - nothing ... What to do? You need to distract the bureaucrat somehow ... "
#TEXT 18
Success! I managed to distract the official, and he left the Port Authority for five minutes. This was enough to rewrite important information from the letter.
Two ships with valuables should leave Caracas, not one! It looks like the booty was big this time... They should rendezvous with the military squadron @<date> at coordinates 12' 50'' and 69' 55''.
Now I am going to Caracas to give the answer to the local port authority. Then they will send ships with cargo to the specified coordinates. Again, I was given ten days to deliver the letter, otherwise the ships simply would not have time to come to the meeting by the required date.
#TEXT 19

Great! Everything went smoothly. The answer has been delivered to Caracas. Now I need to hurry to Shark and closer to @<date> ambush at coordinates 12' 50'' and 69' 55''. I have time to properly prepare, but there is no need to delay. I prepare the ship and go out to Cape Santa Maria.
#TEXT 21
Damn! I took too long to prepare and failed all the deadlines. Steven probably isn't expecting me anymore. You can no longer hope to intercept the cargo.
#TEXT 22
I met Steven at Cape Santa Maria, as we agreed. Shark joined my squadron. I must say that his frigate is really impressive. I myself would not refuse this.
Now we need to hurry: @<date> at coordinates 12' 50'' and 69' 55'' we must intercept our prey.
#TEXT 23
Damn! I took too long to prepare and failed all the deadlines. Steven simply left the squadron and left in the direction of Isla Tesoro. You can no longer hope to intercept the cargo.

I'm not suicidal. I decided to leave the Spaniards. When we sailed here on two frigates, there was no talk of a battle with such a squadron.
The shark left me and went to Isla Tesoro. Alone, I will certainly not compete with the Spanish flotilla. Never mind, better luck next time...
#TEXT 34
The loot was really huge! We shared everything with Steven according to the laws of the Coastal Brotherhood. Shark himself went to Isla Tesoro to be repaired and wash the first successful trip on his new frigate.

I didn't expect that! My dear brother has disappeared. He only left some strange letter for me. But I don't believe that Michel has just gone mad. He is wrong to think that I will return back to Europe just like that. I am still waiting his thanks for saving him from the dungeons.
Despite of all odd insinuations of abbot Benoit, I am sure that Michel is going to continue his adventure with that Indian gold. He mentioned it once. It looks like there a lot of gold, my brother is a resourceful man and he won't work for some trifles. I don't really care about gold, though, I admit, it'll do, I want to talk with my brother who showed me that I am just a pawn in his game, a pawn which only purpose was to get him out of jail.
What should I do first? Who knows Michel best? Philippe de Poincy, no doubt. But I don't think that this old fox will show me cards. I'd better visit the underground base and ask the officer, the Maltese must know anything about my brother!
#TEXT   2
I didn't get a lot from the officer. Except facts I already know, he told me that Michel and de Poincy was working together against Spanish, capturing their ships loaded with treasures. Hm. But why chevalier got so angry on my brother? For what? For a single fail? That transport must had been really important. Perhaps, Michel was just disappointed about all that injustice and decided to escape in peace? To break off with his past? No... My own experience says no. My brother is not some sentimental girl, but a wise strategist and a soldier. Does he fear de Poincy's revenge? No... He has got all he desired, and if he wanted to kill Michel, he would see it done immediately. There is something different... Fine, I'd better interrogate the Spanish captive.

And here I am, drawing into some mess again. The only difference is that I am doing it on my will now. Spanish told me enough... Just think about my brother, huh? I hope to reach his gold before he leaves the archipelago. I suppose that I've got enough time, it doesn't seem that the gold was well hidden, because it doesn't fit with recent events. It's not that obvious...
I will think about it in the mean time. Now I have to instruct the Spanish, I've got a plan ready.
#TEXT   4
My plan is very simple and, in the same time, it is very complex: I need to gain trust of an inquisitor of Santiago, father Vincento himself! There is no point in hiding my true name, he is not a man of primitive games. I will tell him the truth and let's hope on his greed. Let it overwhelm his mistrust. If I am lucky, he will tell me a lot, particularly, the information about Tayasal. This will help in my searches.
Heading to Cuba. I won't land in Santiago, it is too risky. I will land at Santa Maria Bay, it is close to the town gates. My Spanish captive will serve as my messenger to father Vincento.
#TEXT   5
My messenger has gone with a letter to father Vincento. I am offering him my assistance in exchange for a cut. I also wrote about Ramon Mendoza and Miguel Dichoso - he must understand my awareness about Indian gold. I'll wait for a reply and hope that father Vincento will agree to work with an enemy of his nation.
#TEXT   6
Of course! First of all, Father Vincento proposed me to work for the good of Roman Catholic Church and for his own good. I must find some French privateer, not British, not Dutch, but French. This privateer attacked Spanish galleon and stole some priceless church plates. I must find and bring this privateer in the kind hands of holy inquisition. I also must return church plates. It is obvious, that doing this will give him great discrediting evidences against me, because I will be working against my own countrymen under the banner of Spain! Damn it, father Vincento truly owns his title...!!
Though, I ain't got a choice. Let's start with finding this unlucky privateer. We will see then. I must dig some information about this galleon named 'Santa Margarita'. Was it captured near Hispaniola shores? Let's start digging there then...
#TEXT   7
Nobody heard about the ship in Port-au-Prince. I have got no reasons to don't trust the innkeeper, why would he lied? But where is the galleon? I doubt that my privateer would drag it through the whole archipelago somewhere to Martinique. I should continue searching in this area... 
#TEXT   8
I've got a trail. 'Santa Margarita' was captured by some Gaius Marchais and brought to Tortuga. Barman said that the ship was put in docks. Well, I should ask people there...
#TEXT   9
So, 'Santa Margarita' turned into 'Admirable', and privateer Gaius Marchais is now merchant Gaius Marchais. Funny. And where did our newborn trader go?
#TEXT   10
Marchais trails lead to Philipsburg. I have to sail there immediately.
#TEXT   11
Gaius had unshipped in Philipsburg's shop and his current location is unknown. For now. A man on a galleon can not disappear like that. I should continue asking people...
#TEXT   12
Trails lead to Barbados. I have to sail there...
#TEXT   13
Gaius Marchais really was here, in Bridgetown. I must find out where did he sail next. Harbormaster was unable to help me in that, I should look for information in other places.
#TEXT   14
Seems like the end of the ride. Our newborn merchant has made a blunder. Well, I hope that I will catch him in Basse-Terre.
#TEXT   15
Well, well... At last, I have chased my client. His galleon 'Admirable' is here. Now I have to find a way to capture its captain and to check his cabin somehow. I wish I find there church plates. Direct assault won't work, I am not an idiot to attack French ship right in the port. Let's start with visit Gaius Marchais aboard his ship.
#TEXT   16
Fame and glory are great, of course, yet not in my current position. Gaius's boatswain recognized 'A hero of Saint Pierre' as soon as I've got aboard... A single mistake of mine - and all Caribbean will learn who has kidnapped Marchais. It won't to make more popular and de Poincy won't be happy about me.
So, here is what we've got: Gaius Marchais is sitting in a tavern and waiting for those famous merchants, his galleon lying out and a complete uncertainty. This damn looser trader may stay here for a year and I won't be able to do anything: I can't attack his galleon and I can't capture the man right in the town. I must think of making Gaius to leave Basse-Terre and, perhaps, alone in the sea, no witnesses... But the idiot is not going to leave this place until he sells his vanilla. What should I do?
#TEXT   17
Suddenly, I came up to idea - I saw carraca at the port, got know its captain, who turned out to be Spanish and proposed him to buy vanilla from Marchais. Carlos assured me that the deal will take place. He will make his own profits from this deal after all. I will get Gaius as soon as he sells his cargo and sails to the open sea.
#TEXT   18
Carlos has managed to arrange the deal. The cargo will be transshipped on his carraca at Casper Bay tomorrow at midday. I should rise up anchors and sail to Unapproachable cape - let them think that I've left Guadeloupe. Nobody will think that I have something to do with Marchais's disappearance.
#TEXT   19
That's the reason why 'Admirable' is still here! The town is crawling with drunken sailors from the galleon, obviously, he has paid them their wage from my pocket. Looks like there are only a few watches left on the ship, I should use this chance and get aboard. Then I will sneak into the captain quarters and kidnap Gaius. Heavy risk, but the prize... Nobody shall suspect me in this.
#TEXT   20
My plan has worked just perfectly.  Gaius was put into the cabin as a valuable prisoner, guarded and in chains. I imagine, how sailors of 'Admirable' will be surprised when they return back on their ship... But I am clear of suspicions, that is the most important thing.
Luckless privateer refused to tell me about church plates. I didn't find any of them in his cabin, it means that he has already sold them. He will speak eventually. Inquisition can loosen people's tongues easily. Sailing to Cuba, to Santiago's lighthouse, I should give my prisoner to the inquisitor and take my vanilla.
#TEXT   21
Gaius Marchais was delivered, I also wrote a letter to father Vincento about 'Santa Margarita' and asked him to help in finding out the location of church plates. I am confident in methods of holy fathers, no doubt, poor Gaius will tell them everything he knows. I should wait two days for the answer.
#TEXT   22
Father Vincento gave me the information I needed, just as I expected. Now I have to visit a usurer from Willemstad and a church of Basse-Terre.

A banker of Curacao told me that a golden censer was bought by some pirate named Rollie the Cap, who was captured soon by colonel Fox. He is probably drying already under the hot sun of St.John's. I should ask Fox about censer, perhaps, his men have confiscated it.
Ostensory was bought by some senora Belinda de Ribero of Cumana, relative to a governor himself. It's just getting better and better...
#TEXT   24
Colonel Fox told me that golden censer with other Rollie's 'stuff' could be hidden somewhere on Dominica. I don't have any more clues, I have to search the island's secluded places, I may find something...

I had a conversation with father Vincento. I've learnt a lot of very odd information... According to the inquisitor, all Christian world is in a danger of some evil, this evil is somehow connected with Indians Maya-Iza  and treasures which were taken by Miguel Dichoso from Tayasal. There is something in those treasures which can stop the evil. Easy enough and so convenient! I see now how holy people make their fortunes, fighting with evil seems profitable... Though I admit, he was talking about this ancient evil very seriously. I am lost in riddles. I don't think that he believed in my loyalty to Roman Catholic Church, but there is nothing for me to worry about while our goals are same.
And concerning my new task... @<sText>
#TEXT   36
So, I've found Gino Gvineili in St.John's. He lives in John Murdock's place. I will try to draw him out.
#TEXT   37
Isn't that something! Gino said that our world is close to its end. Kukulcan itself is going to wipe away our reality by changing the past. Perhaps, Gino has been breathing from his flasks for too long and gone mad, but this means that father Vincento's mind is also damaged, and that is the most unlikely. So I have to find other two components of Guardian of Truth, the compass and the map. Then I have to search for that mysterious Ksocheatem island.
Some Archibald Calhoun owns the compass. And the map belongs to inquisition... I should ask father Vincento about it, very carefully.
#TEXT   38
It seems that father Vincento has trusted me and believes that Gino is dead. Well, that's better for all of us! I wonder how long would he last in the hand of the inquisition? A day, two days or a week?
The map 'of Two Appearances' is in the hands of Ramon de Mendoza and so are all others belonging of Ksatl Cha. Pity, that is not good! This cabaliero is unreachable for now... all in good time. Now I have to head to Trinidad, the last place where a frigate of Miguel Dichoso was seen.
#TEXT   39
According to the local harbormaster -Miguel Dichoso really was in San Jose on his frigate 'Santa Quiteria'. His was planning to sail to Cadiz, to Europe. I have to continue asking all people who have connections with the sea, perhaps, someone will tell me something useful.
#TEXT   40
The local innkeeper remembers the arrival of Miguel Dichoso at San Jose, he was sulky and moody, all his men were professional fighters. That is all I have learnt.
#TEXT   41
At last, I've found out something interesting. A light-house keeper told me an interesting story about Miguel Dichoso and his frigate. My worst fears come true: the Indian gold was on the ship and it's cursed. Trying to leave Caribbean with it causes a storm which drags the vessel to Ksocheatem. Perhaps, Gino was right.
It seems that Miguel Dichoso is dead, and his gold is lying either at the bottom of the sea, or at the shores of Ksocheatem. But how does it connect with my brother? It's nonsense.
Two interesting facts, I've learnt from a light-house keeper:
1. Diego de Montoya, the commander of the squadron which stormed Saint-Pierre, is also interested in Miguel and his frigate.
2.  The storm was drawing 'Santa Quiteria'  from Trinidad to Martinique.
So, perhaps, Diego thought that Dichoso is in Saint-Pierre? Riddles again. I must find Ksocheatem first, if, of course, it exists for real. What should I do next? I'd better see father Vincento and tell him about Diego. He may arrange a meeting with this Spanish.
#TEXT   42
I had a strange meeting near the lighthouse: I was stopped by Spanish patrol, they have checked my letter of credence, signed by father Vincento, and patrol officer has shown a great interest to my dagger and offered to sell it for a great sum of golden coins. Of course, I refused to sell it. Too many weapon collectors are stalking around the archipelago, I don't like it. I must be careful.
#TEXT   43
I had a talk with father Vincento and it was pointless, it seems that he is stuck too. I should see him in a week, perhaps, he will tell me some good news.
I still think, that I have to search for Diego de Montoya: he knows about Dichoso much more than me and father Vincento, he is also close to baron de Mendoza, who owns a component of Guardian of Truth - the map. I won't find mysterious Ksocheatem without it. I am starting to believe in what Ksatl Cha said...
#TEXT   44
This time I was lucky to meet my ex captive Spanish officer. He told me that Diego  is going to sail somewhere to Western Main from Havana. Time to sail to Havana and try intercepting him if I would have a chance.
#TEXT   45
Some serious looking scums tried to rob me. That is something new for me. What exactly did he want? Perhaps, this is my rare daggers 'collector' from Trinidad?
#TEXT   46
I've reached Havana but I don't see any squadron. I won't sail right to the port, I'd better land at Batabano Bay without drawing the attention. It is close to the town, so I will be able to ask locals about Diego and his squadron. My letter of credence won't impress guards, but it will do for commoners.
#TEXT   47
The innkeeper has given me full information about Diego's location suspiciously easy. Do they really respect Jesuit brothers that much? It seems, that Montoya is repairing his ship somewhere at San Antonio cape, it is the southern point of Cuba. I have to land there and explore the place. But I will better - I will send boarding party on foot through the jungles, they will serve as my cover...
#TEXT   48
Boarding party is heading to San Antonio cape through the jungles and they will reach it in six hours. I will land there in sex hours then. I hope that Diego is actually repairing his ship instead of preparing the guns...
#TEXT   49
That was expected, don Diego de Montoya also known as the mysterious dagger collector, has prepared a trap for me with the help of my ex captive. It seems that the innkeeper of Havana has played his part in this too. I should pay him a visit later... and hang him on his own dirty apron... Spanish are destroyed, but Diego has escaped. Time to sail.
#TEXT   50
I was ambushed by a heavy galleon. I had to fight it while Diego was escaping on his courier lugger in the direction of Main. I don't even see his sails at horizon. I have to chase him down!
#TEXT   51
Diego's lugger has arrived to Catoche cape. His squadron is cruising around. The fight is unavoidable. To arms!
#TEXT   52
Spanish squadron is destroyed. Damn Diego wasn't participating in the fight and landed at the shore. I am going to take my boarding party and chase the bastard to death.
#TEXT   53
We were attacked by Spanish troops at the shore, so we killed them all. Though there was no Diego among corpses. Heading to the jungles.
#TEXT   54
We have found a small Spanish fort in the depth of jungles. Obviously, don Diego de Montoya has lied there. I have to storm it.
#TEXT   55
Fort's garrison is defeated. Diego and the rest of the Spanish are holding the basement. I should clear them out.
#TEXT   56
Diego de Montoya is eliminated. He didn't tell me a thing about Dichoso or anything else. But he had a leather map 'Of two Appearances' - the second component of Guardian of Truth. It means, that Diego was aware about Gino told me...
I wonder why Diego had built this fort. It seems, that it supposed to be a fore post for another Tayasal campaign. That is the only explanation I've got. Fort is looking damaged, someone had already stormed it before I did. That is why it was so easy for me to capture it.
Heading to the shores.
#TEXT   57
Look at this... I've met some English captain called William Paterson who was storming the fort recently and now he has returned with greater forces to finish the Spanish. He was mostly disappointed when he heard that don Diego de Montoya is dead. But there one more thing. His first mate is Archibald Colhaun, the Archibald Colhaun who has started this Tayasal madness! I bet that Paterson attacked Diego's fort not because it was built near Belize.
#TEXT   58
Paterson's squadron is good, really good! Especially his flagship, I've never seen any frigate like this before... And it has a suitable name - 'Fortune'. I'll remember it, I have to talk with Archibald Colhaun anyway. He must know what happened with the compass. But it is not the right time for such conversations. Besides, I don't like such a coincidence - Diego and Archibald in the same place at the same time. I don't believe in coincidences nowadays.
#TEXT   59
Something is very wrong here. Dichoso is alive, 'Santa Quiteria' was seen here with under the new name... What the hell is going on! I am going to Isla Tesoro, I must learn about Dichoso's frigate and about the man himself.
But Archibald Colhaun is my top priority now, only he can tell me about the last component of the Guardian of Truth. And I don't have any ideas how to get him.
#TEXT   60
My talk with Steven not only didn't help me out, but has added new contradictions. 'Santa Quiteria' turned out to be 'San Martin'... or is it a different frigate? Shark was familiar with Dichoso once... And Paterson again, his flagship, I liked so much, is the ship which was bought by Steven from Dichoso. Colhaun, Paterson, don Miguel Dichoso - all of them are bonded somehow.
Visiting father Vincento would be pointless - I didn't learn anything useful. I must deal with our sweet couple - Paterson and Colhaun. Let's start by talking with Fadey, he has given me the dagger which Colhaun got from Tayasal.

Two foul characters tried to rob me right in my cabin. How long will it be going on? Who hired them? All chest are opened and rummaged but nothing was stolen. It is obvious that they were looking for something I always carry with me.

I just love to make troubles and powerful enemies! This Paterson seems to be a tough guy. And Calhoun is under his protection...
Heading to Port Royal, Paterson is a captain of Royal Navy and he often visits this place, reporting about his heroic actions to lord Windsdor. I will try to ask people about him.
#TEXT   63
Looks like I am lucky. Paterson's squadron is lying out at Port Royal. I am going to go ashore.
#TEXT   64
I've met Archibald Calhoun face to face right in the town! He also recognized me and, furthermore, he even invited me to share a drink! That was suspicious and was expecting troubles but we had a friendly chat. I managed to leave this hospitable Scot only at late evening.
This meeting was really helpful, now I know where does Colhaun live. I should go there and check his things, perhaps, I will even find the compass among his belongings. I have to wait until Paterson's squadron leaves the town and then I will visit Scot's room at night...
#TEXT   65
Paterson's squadron has left Port Royal. It is time to visit Archibald's place. But how will I get there? The door is closed and, besides, I will have to go through the shop in order to get inside. I can't trust merchant in this business, William Paterson is an important person here, in Port Royal, they will put me in jail if I would try to get inside his first mate's home. I have to find a more secretive way. Perhaps, I should be more attentive and look at the Calhoun's house, there must be a way inside...
#TEXT   66
Climbing was worth it! I didn't find the compass inside but I had an opportunity to read Calhoun's journal which he had been writing during his two year vacation on the uninhabited island. He likes 'rereading it in the warm bad'. 'Arrow of the Way' was left on that island and I've got its approximate coordinates. Let's not waste time!
#TEXT   67
Here it is. Crab island. It was really close to Jamaica. I am going ashore, I have to find Calhoun's hut.
#TEXT   68
I've found the hut. It looks surprisingly lived-in... Now I have to explore the hut, the compass must be somewhere here.
#TEXT   69
Damn it... It's a trap! There is no 'Arrow of the Way' but there are mines and aggressive people... I must get out of here!
#TEXT   70
Paterson and Colhaun have lured me at the uninhabited and unknown island to take the dagger and the map, and to get rid of their competitor. Paterson knows about 'Guardian of Truth' and, I suppose, he is also eager to find Ksocheatem... I barely managed to escape from their trap made by Scot. His musketeers are destroyed. Paterson has run into the jungles. I must get him!
#TEXT   71
Foul Scot run away to the bay where I was met by Archibald Colhaun and his girls. The fight was tough, but all of them are lying down on the sands. I'd better loot Achi's body, he was using an interesting double barreled musket, and, perhaps, I might find something helpful...
#TEXT   72
I've found not only a great musket, but an interesting key on Archibald's corpse. Now I only have to find the lock.
Time to prepare for an upcoming battle - Paterson's squadron is somewhere around.
#TEXT   73
Paterson's squadron is destroyed and the Scot himself is eliminated. One enemy less.. How many of them had I? And how many I will have?
Now, my top priority is to find 'Arrow of the Way'. Paterson mentioned that it is hidden on Jamaica, but not in Port Royal, somewhere where no one will search for it. But I'll find it, I have to find this damn compass!
#TEXT   74
The last component is found. Now I must think about using Guardian of Truth to find Ksocheatem. Because, I suppose, that finding this island would answer a lot of questions and solve a lot of riddles about Dichoso, his lost frigate, Indian treasures and my brother. Diego and Paterson were so eager to get the Guardian! It means that there is something rational in it... If there is an island, then there is a Kukulcan mask which will let me to save our course of time and to stop Kukulcan... damn it, I've never thought that one day I will be reasoning this way! Seems like I share father's Vincento uneasiness and Gino's concerns...
I won't go to father Vincento until I find Ksocheatem. This mess about 'Santa Quiteria', 'San Martin', 'Fortune' and Miguel Dichoso is not understandable until I find the island. Gino will help me to make the Guardian work. Time to sail to Antigua!
#TEXT   75
Paterson's squadron is defeated, and the Scot himself is dead. One less enemy ... But how many of them have I had and will there be more?
Now the main task is to find the 'Arrow of the Way' compass. Paterson said that he was in Jamaica, but not in Port Royal, but in some place where no one would think to look for him. But I'll think, damn it, and find this ill-fated compass!

'Fortune' is indeed an excellent ship. Maybe show it to Steven on occasion? I will please the sea wolf ...

Half of job is done - the dagger and the map are working! Now I have to visit places, marked by the map of Two Appearances. I don't know what are these places yet. I only know that first one is in the center of Dominica, the second is north west from Blueweld. Time to sail.
#TEXT   3
I've found one of the 'Appearances'! This is an Indian statue in the jungles. It made the arrow to stop its chaotic movement and to show a solid direction. I will mark this line on the map, Ksocheatem must be somewhere on this line. I need to find the second 'appearance' if I want to get an accurate location. Heading to Dominica.

We have arrived to Ksocheatem. Yes, this is a creepy place! We must be careful, I don't like the feeling of this place. So, my goal is to find 'Santa Quiteria' and a Kukulcan mask to prevail... the end of the world? Perhaps, my brother is here too.
#TEXT   7
I've found a bay, covered by reefs, there are debris and a few skeletons, the ship's crew, I suppose. Is this 'Santa Quiteria'? I didn't find a name plate. No sign of Indian gold. The loot is pathetic, my brother wouldn't even move his finger for this. What if all gold is lying at the bottom of the sea?
#TEXT   8
I have reached a bay through the sunken grotto. There are a broken ship and numerous chests and barrels lying around the sand. And, of course, more skeletons. I have to swim to the ship's debris and to check its cargo holds, I am feeling that this is what I was looking for.
#TEXT   9
Yes! 'Santa Quiteria'. This bay was the end of Dichoso's frigate. So we have got two similar frigates: 'San Martin' also known as 'Fortune' and 'Santa Quiteria' which is lying here. All of its treasures belong to me now! If I find a Kukulcan mask, then my mission will be fulfilled.
There are too many treasures and I won't be able to move them all alone. I should return to my ship and drop the anchor here.

I've found another ancient mask. It was inside a metal locked box lying on the sand. If I hadn't found Guardian's grotto, I would've believed that it is the real mask. I don't want to think what could happen if that was the case...
#TEXT   12
I've found some sort of the ancient Indian temple with a terrible Guardian of Ksocheatem, it's a giant skeleton of the Spanish who was sacrificed in Tayasal long time ago. I had a tough fight with the creature, but I had showed him what a naval captain is capable for, so he decided that I am worthy to negotiate with. I gave him my dagger, which was used to kill him in times when he was still a living man, and he let me to take the mask. He has even fortified my skills somehow.
Guardian has gone, he received his dagger and a long-awaited rest. I have to take the mask and leave this place as soon as possible.

I've got a Kukulcan mask! His incarnation will never reach the past and he won't be able to change it. My expedition to Ksocheatem  is complete!

I was met by 'a guest from the past' at Cliffy bay - some man called Alonso de Maldonado. He was eager to get the mask and revenge me for the death of his patron, Diego de Montoya. Negotiations failed and I had to use bullets and steel. I have to sail immediately and deal with Spanish once and for all.
#TEXT   15
Maldonado's squadron was destroyed. How many surprises are waiting for me?
An interesting fact: father Vincento helped Maldonado to track me down. That was expected, the Inquisitor has started playing against me. Well, one powerful enemy more. I am getting used to it.
Now I should go downstairs and tell Gino about my progress.
#TEXT   16
As far as I understand, Maldonado was going to attack Tayasal and use the mask to close the portal forever in order to prevent Kukulcan from getting to the past. Ksocheatem made me treat Kukulcan seriously. As opposed to Gino, I am not sure that claiming the mask will destroy Kanek's plans. I fear that Kukulcan's incarnation is able to get in the past even without a mask. To guarantee our salvation, I have to go to Tayasal... Though Gino is assuring me that there is no need in such radical actions. I am presented a choice: an expedition to Tayasal is extremely dangerous and it might be just a deadly trap, but if Kukulcan would reach the past then our world will vanish. In the other hand, I have got the mask and Kukulcan's incarnation won't be able to pass through the portal, so there is nothing to be worry about. And, by the way, I haven't still found my brother...
Whatever. First, I should deliver Gino back to Antigua.
#TEXT   17

That crazy old man, Abraham Norman, has helped me a lot. It seems that he is not that crazy because he managed to open my eyes to see obvious things. Why had I been that blind for so long? Miguel Dichoso and Michel de Monper are the same person, it's my brother! Michel the Lucky man, that is how they called him in the army for his fortune... I don't get why Abraham believes that Michel is a half-blood, he is my brother. That is the worst kind of brothers, I suppose...
Michel has gone to Blueweld and he left his dogs at Isla Tesoro to keep me here. Well, I will deal with them. Time for a fight.

According to the letter, Michel decided to get rid of me in the most radical way. It seems, that I am a big pain in his butt. Well, I suppose, that he won't help me find Tayasal, I'll have to do that myself. I should leave this place quickly.

And what would I do without my shaman friend? Snake Eye not only has solved the riddle of statues, but made a calendar from the shards, I was lucky enough to keep. I hope that we were right... I am going to see the statue and try to insert the calendar in a deepening Snake Eye was talking about.
#TEXT   18
Once again, Snake Eye has proven his wisdom. The calendar fits excellently and the statue seems to be alive now. I am almost confident that statues will now work properly and teleport people to Tayasal as they were meant to do. That is great, I will evade the dangerous jungles of Yucatan. I will send my ship to wait for me at the Gulf of Death.

So, I have reached Tayasal. After a tough fight with Indians at the outskirts of the city, I was met by Urakan himself, the war chief of Itza people. He is a son of Kanek, who has summoned Kukulcan, or, to put it right, its incarnation. He is waiting for me. I should go to the big temple of Tayasal.
#TEXT   26
My brother, my dear brother Michel de Monper also known as Miguel Dichoso is Kukulcan... My mind is barely holding on. I've been helping Kukulcan to destroy our reality. Impossible! But I was able to fix the situation and survived the fight with my Kukulcan brother and his minions. Urakan has joined my side, he believes that I am the incarnation of Cavil, another of their gods. Poor Indians...
Now I have to destroy the time portal to prevent anyone from reaching the past. Urakan doesn't know how to seal it, but he read me some of their writings. "When the sun rises against the rain, and the fire between them, is held in a triangle, Tohil shall hit the ground and burn the mask on the altar and close the gates forever." I must think about it!
Besides, Urakan said that the portal is sealed, Kanek was opening it himself, saying: "The sun rises and passes, water rises and drowns, fire lights and dies out, war and peace replace each other, only the sky is essential." Another Indian riddle.
Let's start with looting Kanek's body.
#TEXT   27
I've found a strange key on Kanek's corpse. I must find out its usage, I am sure, that he was carrying it for a reason!
#TEXT   28

#TEXT   30
It turns out that the temple of Kukulcan opens by placing ancient tablets of Itzamna inside the special deepening behind the temple. That explains Kanek's words about the sky being stronger than time... I am going to see this portal of time.

Urakan claims that tablets of Mayan gods may serve as keys for mechanisms, doors, and magic rituals.
#TEXT   32
Urakan doesn't know how to open the door that leads to the Itza treasury. Only his father was allowed to open it. Urakan told me his father's saying: "Every wealth is two-sided. Only those who know both sides will be allowed to the treasures of Tayasal."

The Caleuche

Today I have obtained a strange Indian amulet. I have no idea what it's used for, but the experience I gained during my stay in the Caribbean tells me that this is no mere trinket. The amulet is ancient and it almost emanates some unknown power. I'd better ask people who know about such things.
#TEXT   2
The lighthouse keeper told me an interesting story about that amulet I found. Everything looks even more interesting now. If I want to know more, I have to go to Dominica to the Caribbean village and find a certain shaman there. Moreover, I should bring a musket to present it to him, or our conversation might not happen at all. A military musket of a naval carabine should do.
#TEXT   3
I have talked to Tuttuathapak, shaman of the Caribs. It turns out that I cannot make any use of this particular amulet, but if I manage to find two more similar amulets, which at some point had been taken from Tuttuathapak's homeland by a slaver, the shaman will bestow some 'power' upon me. Tuttuathapak surely doesn't look like a joker, so it makes sense to start searching for them. I should return to my old acquaintance, the lighthouse keeper, and ask him more questions.
#TEXT   4
As soon as we had set sail, a storm suddenly occurred, and then something terrible happened: we were attacked by the ghost ship, the 'Flying Dutchman'! They boarded us very skillfully, and the reason for the attack was that Indian amulet. The captain of the ghost ship took it from me, almost killing me in the process... It was a miracle that I survived.
#TEXT   5
My ship was severely crippled by the 'Flying Dutchman', but part of my crew, the officers and I managed to survive. I am going to visit Tuttuathapak - he would surely know why the dead captain might need that amulet.
#TEXT   6
After talking to the shaman I learned many interesting things. Caleuche, the ghost ship, is scouring the Caribbean Sea in search of artifacts of the ancient Chavins, which had been taken from the mainland to the Caribbean. Its crew is cursed by the Indian God of Death, Yum Cimil, and in order to lift his curse and beat Caleuche in battle, I will need to obtain the jade skull of Yum Cimil, which had been stolen by the captain of the ghost ship from the Indian sanctuary quite some time ago. Quite a story!
Alright, now I will search for two other amulets. If I manage to find them, I'll have to be very careful and avoid encountering Caleuche again by all possible means. I have no chance to best it in naval combat or by boarding, so my only hope is to outrun it. Considering that Caleuche is very fast, I will need an even faster ship for that.
#TEXT   7
I have talked to the keeper of the lighthouse. Now I must find a Fergus Hoper, a hunter from Beliz, and a mysterious Jack-Jackson from Barbados, who sails a xebec named after 'a bird woman, born from the sea gods'.

Fergus Hooper shall return from the jungle no sooner than in three days' time. It is better to look for him in the tavern, where he usually spends his time from six to ten in the evening.
#TEXT   9
Now that's a stroke of bad luck... The amulet I needed so much was stolen from Fergus' house. This was the work of some bandits, who had recently emerged in the vicinity of Beliz. I should pay the commandant a visit and ask him about it - perhaps he knows something.
#TEXT   10
The conversation with the commandant was all but fruitless. I'll have to act on my own. Both Fergus and the commandant claimed that the bandits had accomplices in town. I'll need to work in that direction.
#TEXT   11
In one of the houses, I encountered a very unpleasant type. I offered him to walk with me to the commandant's office, but he refused and drew his sword. I had to calm him down. Now to search the body - it looks like this bandit belongs to the gang I am looking for.
#TEXT   12
I have found a letter to the ringleader containing an instruction and some clue. Now I'll have to go to the bandits in the jungle, pretending to be their messenger.
#TEXT   13
My affair with the bandits ended up successfully - I learned where their 'headquarters' were located. This is a cavern in the jungle, the left one if going out of the city. Surely the scoundrels are hiding their stolen loot inside. I will need to come there after midnight and search it thoroughly.
#TEXT   14
I managed to find the bandit's cache under the planks in one of the galleries, and there the amulet which I needed. Unfortunately, it didn't go without hardships: a couple of bandits caught me red-handed, and I had to talk with them using the language of knife and pistol.
Now I am going to Dominica again to see Tuttuathapak: sailing the seas with this amulet in my pocket is very dangerous.
#TEXT   15
I told the commandant about the time and place where the meeting of the gang shall take place. He promised to send soldiers there. I'll drop in after three days - to find out about the results of the ambush and to receive my reward if I am eligible for any.

The second amulet of the Chavins has been handed to Tuttuathapak. One more is still to be found.
#TEXT   23
The third amulet of the Chavins has been handed to Tuttuathapak. Now I need to focus on my search for the jade skull.
#TEXT   24
In Willemstad I was approached by a monk who had a strange request for me: @<sText> But if I want to find the artifact of Yum Cimil, I must overcome my fear.
#TEXT   25
My premonition didn't deceive me! In the darkest hour of the night, out of nowhere a terrible skeleton with a great axe emerged engulfed in hellish flames, and attacked me! I destroyed the monster. It seems that it was none other than the former landlady of the house, judging by the things I found on the skeleton. Looks like Merriman is a fearsome warlock indeed. I must tell about it to the father superior of the church in Willemstad, just like the monk requested.
#TEXT   26
Apparently, the traces of Merriman's activity emerged in Cuba. I am heading to the priest of Havana, as the father superior of the church in Willemstad had recommended.
#TEXT   27
It's time to find out whether the hunters were telling the truth. I am heading to the cave in the jungle. I must be careful...
#TEXT   28
The cave was crawling with the living dead. Once they all were destroyed, a huge monster appeared out of the water - an Indian mummy with jaguar fangs and a huge mace. Now I am certain these were Merriman's tricks. The jade skull of the Chavins summoned jaguar warriors, about which Tuttuathapak was telling me. Now I am heading to the priest of Havana with my report.
#TEXT   29
The story with the jade skull is getting worse and worse. Apparently, Merriman uses the skull to turn people into zombies. I must find the Portuguese before he causes even more trouble. Joachim's lair should be located somewhere in Cuba. But where exactly?
#TEXT   30
The lair of Joachim Merriman has been found - he is hiding in a cave, the entrance to which is located in the cemetery crypt behind a locked door. I have the key to it, so I can go there right away. Still, I must keep in mind that Merriman is very dangerous and he's unlikely to welcome me warmly, so I better prepare for my visit to him. But I shall not delay, either - in two days at most the inquisitor in Santiago will receive the dispatch of the father superior in Havana, and then everything there will be crawling with Spanish soldiers.
#TEXT   31
I delayed the raid of Merriman too much, and the inquisition got ahead of me. I don't even know whether he was caught or sneaked away. In any case, the jade skull of Yum Cimil has been lost for good. There's no point in returning to Tuttuathapak anymore.
#TEXT   32
Necromancer Merriman was a tough nut, and his summoned Chavinavi monsters were really terrifying, but I managed to come out victorious in this hard fight. Now to search the body of the warlock and take the jade skull.
#TEXT   33
I now have the jade skull of Yum Cimil. Now to Dominica, to see Tuttuathapak.
#TEXT   34
The next step is taking the jade skull to the temple of Chavins, which is located on some uninhabited island in the Archipelago. The only thing I know about it is that it is located to the North of Dominica near the ocean. @<sText> And I must hurry - I only have one month to return the skull to the temple. After a month has passed, amulets of Tuttuathapak will lose their power, and I won't be able to pass the temple guardians - the frightful Chavinavi.
#TEXT   35
I have talked to Nathaniel Hawk! Now I know the coordinates of Khael Roa: 19 degrees 32 minutes North, 62 degrees 25 minutes West. Besides, Nathan told me about the dangers waiting for me in the temple.
#TEXT   36
I have arrived at Khael Roa. This is a small rocky gloomy island. Now I am heading into the jungle to search for the old island.
#TEXT   37
The jade skull lies now on the pedestal before the bird statue, of which Tuttuathapak was telling me. The curse now must be lifted from Caleuche. Now I am returning to my ship and begin my hunt.
#TEXT   38
In the temple sanctuary, I have met the chieftain of the Chavinavi and talked to him. Not only have I put the jade skull on the pedestal at the statue of the condor, but I also received a decent gift from the terrible temple guardian.
The curse now must be lifted from Caleuche. Now I am returning to my ship and begin my hunt.
#TEXT   39
The ghost ship was found and captured, and its fearful crew led by the skeleton captain was destroyed for good. No longer shall Caleuche frighten the sailors. All three amulets of the Chavins are now mine. I am returning to Tuttuathapak for the reward he promised.
#TEXT   40
I managed to fail the entire mission at the very end: the amulet, which Tuttuathapak needed so badly, is now lost forever. I guess I better not go to visit him at all - he might curse me with insanity, like that ill-fated captain...
#TEXT   41
The shaman rewarded me with three powerful potions, which shall permanently increase my reaction, endurance, and some other characteristic of my choice. But in order for him to make me these potions I shall bring the shaman five stems of a herb called Manga Rosa.
#TEXT   42
Well, that's the end of this long story. I received from the shaman three great potions, which surely will help me in my journeys, and Tuttuathapak has his amulets, which will help him to comprehend the wisdom of his ancestors, the ancient Chavins.
#TEXT   43
I have spent too much time in search of the island, and the amulets of Tuttuathapak have lost their power. I failed to return the jade skull back to the temple, and Tuttuathapak refused to deal with me any further. Well, nothing to do here, it was all my fault.
#TEXT   44
I have found quite a curious hall in the depths of the temple. There are stone floor plates and pillars. The exit which apparently leads to the sanctuary is blocked by a massive stone door. I should find a way to open it. Investigating this hall would be a good start.

So, Poincy wants to teach the Spaniards a good word for the attack on St. Pierre. And the colony of San Jose on Trinidad will answer for the short-sightedness of Don Mendosa. To bombard the fort, I must have the 66-gun ship 'Eclatant' in the squadron. I will be able to find her at the road of Capsterville.
#TEXT   2

I have a diplomatic affair, to bring to Willemstad on Curacao a letter for Peter Stuyvesant the leader of the Dutch Trade Company himself, and to escort a shipment of goods. I'm curious as to what business does Poincy have with Stuyvesant?.. This has to be done in a matter of three weeks, while Peter hasn't departed from Curacao yet.
#TEXT   21
It took me too long to get to Curacao, and Stuyvesant already left. The captain of the cargo ship lost his patience and left the squadron. Perhaps I shouldn't disturb Poincy and find myself some better business. I'll never become an officer.

Losing a trade vessel is a shameful display! I'll never become an officer.

My task in Curacao is done. A written response from Stuyvesant for Poincy has been obtained, It's time to head back. I shouldn't linger though as I'm expected to meet with Chevalier no later than in a month's time.
#TEXT   24
I was busy with other matters and completely forgot about Stuyvesant's letter. Well, well, I will not go to Poincy, I'm tired of performing all kinds of silly orders, I will live freely as before.
#TEXT   24_1
I'm fed up with risking my life under cannonfire while solving the commercial problems of Poincy. I did not imagine a service in the Navy to be like this. I decided that I had enough, I'd rather live freely, as I did before.
#TEXT   25
I got a promotion: Poincy granted me the rank of a Commodore! This is quite fortunate, my brother would be amazed by this, I'm sure... And the Governor of Port-au-Prince sent me a generous gift: 500 bags of coffee, 500 cocoa boxes, and 50 logs of baket. I'll be able to pick up all this at the Capsterville store whenever I want. And my next assignment is to await the arrival of the baron from the southern colonies and take him to Sint Maarten.
#TEXT   26
Baron Noel Forget is on board, now I have to depart for Sint Maarten. I have 7 days at my disposal.
#TEXT   27
Cursed be this day! I hardly entered the harbor of Philipsburg and prepared to anchor when my ship was shot at from the fort! And I am attacked by Dutch ships! Hold on, you rascals! We must leave the area of reach of the fort and deal with the enemy squadron.
#TEXT   28
The Dutch ships have been destroyed. I need to get out of here as fast as I can.
#TEXT   29
Chevalier himself was shocked by the incident - he did not give any intelligible explanation of the sudden aggression of the Dutch, although it seems to me that he knows much more than he says ... I shall once again go to Curacao, to Stuyvesant.
#TEXT   30
It seems that Poincy and Stuyvesant had a quarrel over something they could not share fairly. Fine. I will report everything to the Chevalier upon arrival on Saint Christopher.
#TEXT   31
It seems that Poincy and Stuyvesant had a quarrel over something they could not share fairly. But it had the biggest negative impact on me. Stuyvesant decided to arrest me, but he failed at it. He did not know who he was dealing with... Fine. I will report everything to the Chevalier upon arrival on Saint Christopher.
#TEXT   32
On the way back, the Dutch military squadron got behind me and attacked me. Well this is too much! The bastards really done it now.
#TEXT   33
So that's what it is! Poincy conducted secret commercial business with Stuyvesant, selling through the Company the salt from the mine located on Sint Maarten! It is quite in the spirit of the Chevalier - use others in various scams ... Now I understand why Poincy delayed the inspection of Sint Maarten by Baron Forget - it was necessary to coordinate with Stuyvesant how to 'cover' the salt business from the eyes of the inspector. Yes, only the director of the Company turned out to be that same cheat - he decided to take advantage of the opportunity and get rid of the partner. Fine ... Chevalier clearly decided to teach Stuyvesant a lesson - the old fox does not forgive such trickery. Tomorrow I should come to Poincy for a new assignment.
#TEXT   34
Well, that was expected: I must go to the shores of Sint Maarten and organize a hunt for Dutch merchant ships bound for Philipsburg. And I shouldn't waste my time: I need to attack only the east indiamans - the backbone of the Company's merchant fleet. In total, I need to seize and bring to the port of Capsterville five such ships.
#TEXT   35
Now I only have to capture the @<sQty> of the Dutch East Indies Trading Company.
#TEXT   36
The task was fulfilled successfully. Now I can rest for a bit before I receive any new orders from Poincy.
#TEXT   37
Why am I not surprised? Saint Christopher is besieged by a powerful Spanish squadron. I have no doubt that this is Stuyvesant's answer to our with Poincy's doings off the coast of Sint Maarten. I urgently need to get to the Chevalier.
#TEXT   38
So, I must go for help to the British at Antigua, to Colonel Doily. I need not only to slip past the enemies myself but also to bring behind me a courier lugger that will go south to Guadeloupe with an order to the captain of the 'Eclatant'.
#TEXT   39
The courier lugger to my great regret was sunk by enemy ships. It is very unfortunate that there will be no one to deliver the request for help to the besieged captain of the 'Eclatant'...
#TEXT   40
The courier lugger has successfully departed to the sovereign sea through the siege and now will sail for Guadeloupe. And I must hurry to St. John.
#TEXT   41
It took me too long to get to Antigua - fishermen from the oncoming ship told me that it is rumored that Capsterville fell to the Spaniards and the Dutch. And all this because of my hesitation. France lost an entire colony. Such a shame...
#TEXT   42
Having read Poincy's message, Doily immediately agreed to help the besieged Capsterville. I wonder what Chevalier promised him? We must prepare for a difficult battle. I'm glad that Doily's squadron is strong enough, especially its flagship: a 100-gun battleship of the 1st rank. English forces will be ready in a month from now. I think that we will win.
#TEXT   43
It took me too long to get to Capsterville and the squadron of Colonel Doily went to battle without me. Fine, with such power as Doyle's flagship, they will manage themselves, and I will live in peace, as I did before - free of any assignments and orders.
#TEXT   44
The battle was difficult, but we reigned victorious. The Spanish-Dutch squadron has been destroyed.
#TEXT   45
Poincy gave me a week off. I'm sure that in this time he will be discussing what he promised Doily in the letter...
#TEXT   46
My week off is over, it's time to meet with Poincy.
#TEXT   47
I decided that I no longer wanted to participate in Poincy's intrigues, covering his back from the Dutch and the Spaniards. Let Doily do it now, and I will live free, as I did before.
#TEXT   48
I have a serious matter to do: no later than two months, I need to drive the Dutch out of Sint Maarten, including the salt mine, and return the island to the French.

Resistance of the enemy is broken, Philipsburg is ours. Now I must find the salt mine and cleanse it from the Dutch.
#TEXT   50_1
Martin Thomas did not really resist at all, and he laid out the scheme of the way to the mine. I need to return to the ship, land in the Grand Case Bay in the north of the island together with the assault group and look for a passage along the coastline near the stones at the edge of the bay.
#TEXT   51
Huh! It wasn't the Dutch at the mine, but the Spaniards! They fought back fiercely, but they could not resist my forces. The manager of the mine, hiding in one of the houses, was taken captive. Sint Maarten is completely liberated. It's time to return to St. Christopher - Poincy will be very happy. And the Dutch led by Martin Thomas, let them roll on Curacao on any galoshes that we find in the docks or at the shipyards - I keep my word.
#TEXT   52
For the successful military operation and taking into account past merits, I was awarded the rank of Vice Admiral! Well, almost - this has yet to be confirmed back in Paris, but Chevalier assures that this issue has already been resolved. I can not believe it! If someone told me a couple of years ago that I would become vice admiral of the French fleet, I would have laughed in his face...
And yet another task - to once again step on the tail of Stuyvesant - capture a caravan with slaves from Africa that is headed for Willemstad. Ten days later, it will pass by the coast of Trinidad towards Curacao. The captured slaves should be brought to Jamaica and handed to Colonel Doily. And I suspect why: Doily, apparently, is Poincy's new partner in the salt mine business...
#TEXT   53
I made a fool out of myself because of this Dutch caravan. And would I dare to look Poincy in the eyes now? I'll leave everything to the sharks and live as before, I'm no Vice Admiral. It's laughable to even think about.
#TEXT   54
In the heat of battle, I drowned one ship with slaves. Very unfortunate...
#TEXT   55
I'm such a dullard. How did I manage to sink both ships with the slaves? And now what? Colonel Doily is waiting for the slaves... And I have only a month's time...
#TEXT   56
The Dutch slave caravan was intercepted. I'm going to Colonel Doily in Jamaica. And I have to hurry: there is less than a month's time, otherwise, they may grow weary of waiting.
#TEXT   57
The slaves were transferred to Colonel Doily. There is a serious military operation against the Dutch. I'm leaving for Poincy's.
#TEXT   58
So, Poincy and Doily decided to finish off their prey until he recovered. Sounds reasonable. I have to come to Jamaica and, together with the colonel, go on a vindictive expedition to Curacao. Baron Forget brought good news from Sint Maarten: a part of the trophies captured from the Dutch were transferred to me. I can pick them up at any time in the Capsterville warehouse.
#TEXT   59
I decided to quit the game - I'm tired of being a pawn of Poincy and Doily. They will be swimming in gold, and I'll be doing the dirty work? It's enough for me, they should look for a new puppet, ready to fight for ranks and glory.
#TEXT   60
The vindictive squadron has been formed, together with Colonel Doily, we shall march on Curacao.
#TEXT   61
The fort has been destroyed. Doily will march to the city walls with the artillery from the lagoon of Blanca, and I will land an assault party on Cape Santa Maria and move to Willemstad from there.
#TEXT   62
The resistance of the Dutch at the city gate of Willemstad has been suppressed. It seems that the enemy realized they do not have the slightest chance against our artillery. It's time to give a signal for negotiations.
#TEXT   63
Preliminary negotiations were held. Now we must wait for the arrival of Peter Stuyvesant himself to sign an agreement between the three parties - Britain, France, and Holland.
#TEXT   64
Stuyvesant accepted all the conditions and signed the contract. Excellent! Our mission with Doily was a complete success. Now we shall return to the ships, and I sail for St. Christopher with a report to Poincy.
#TEXT   65
My promotion to the rank of Vice Admiral was signed in Paris. Well, I can only congratulate myself! How many people were able to climb the ladder from a landlubber to the Vice Admiral of the navy? Oh, if only my father had known about it!.. In addition, the governor-general arranged with his tailor to make a new uniform for me worthy of a Vice admiral! I can find the tailor at the port office in Capsterville.
I have a month off. I will report to the Chevalier de Poincy when it ends.
#TEXT   65_1
Nothing can ever be easy. They always demand either money or materials. To make the admiral's uniform, the tailor needs the following:
- My old officer's jacket.
- Detachable cuffs with a collar. If locally made, then a whole batch. Otherwise, I can bring clothing that already has them.
- A bale of cotton for making high-quality fabric.
- A bundle of leather for making a tricorne.
- A roll of silk for lining. Apparently, only shipboard silk will do.
- The Order of Saint Louis, awarded to me by Chevalier de Poincy. God forbid the tailor loses it!
- Tailoring tools - temporarily.
I already have the jacket with the Order. The necessary clothing, cotton, and leather might be in the local store. I should check. As for the silk and the tools... Well, I'll get those too somehow.
I can find the tailor in his workshop to the right of the pier, looking from the sea.
#TEXT   65_2
The admiral's uniform was worth all the trouble! It fits perfectly, and in appearance, is no less elegant than the uniforms of the highest ranks in France. And the Order is now attached to the uniform. The tailor has definitely done a good job.
#TEXT   66
My vacation time has run out, I should report to Poincy.
#TEXT   67
So, Baron Forget's business with his French Trading Company is now interfering with Poincy's affairs. And I need to somehow convince the Baron not to create this organization here. It seems that the Chevalier is very much afraid of the Baron, who is close to the Minister of Finance and the King himself ... A crazy idea: what if it is a good opportunity to get even with the Chevalier for all his sins? For a million, which I collected with such difficulty? For my troubles with pirates? For Tortuga? For all his cunning, cowardice and greed? Or perhaps I should forget about all of this: now Poincy really treats me like a friend, we have developed a really strong bond... I'll think about it. In the meantime - in Port-au-Prince, I'll talk with Noel Forget.
#TEXT   68_1
I decided to side with Poincy until the end. I will be better than him, and I will not commit betrayal. And I know how to convince the baron: with the help of my friend, the pirate baron and the head of the Coastal Brotherhood, Steven Dodson, I will fake a kidnapping. Let the baron feel what pirates are truly capable of on his own hide, and then, perhaps, show some respect for them. Well, we'll make sure that he understands what Poincy wanted him to.

Poincy looked disappointed, but the consequences don't scare him that much. Well, say what you will, but he's one tough soldier. And I myself should really consider going back to Paris.
#TEXT   79
I've decided to make even with Poincy. The capture of the Spanish governor on Sint-Maarten helped us a great deal. The baron has questioned him. Now, we need to dig up some evidence of the English meddling in our mine. I'll go to the Grand Case Cove, on Sint-Maarten, and from there the baron and I can get to the mine. We will go together at night, so as to not attract any attention.
#TEXT   80
We were attacked by an English patrol on the beach near the mine. We had to defend ourselves.
#TEXT   81
The baron wishes to meet Stuyvesant... I'm not so fond of this idea, but I have no choice - I must go to Curacao. I'll land at the bay near the Hato Caves, on the side of the island opposite Willemstad, and I'll send the Spanish captive to the city with the letter.
#TEXT   82
The Spaniard has been sent to Stuyvesant with the letter. Now we wait...
#TEXT   83
Stuyvesant and Poincy are like twins: one wants a million, and so does the other... But what can I do: I need to bring money to the wretched Dutchman, or I'll have problems I won't be able to deal with anytime soon.

I have Stuyvesant's ledger. Now, I should go to the baron's cabin and give him the book. I hope that will be enough. The cooperation with Monsieur Forget turned out to be quite expensive.

So, it is done. Now, I only have to take the baron to Saint-Christopher. 
#TEXT   86
The baron has been brought to Capsterville successfully. Let him sing his little tune for the chevalier now, and I'll come to Poincy tomorrow. And then - I wait for the resolution for half a year. It would have been quite interesting to see the chevalier's face when they tell him: 'Chevalier Philippe de Poincy, in the name of the King, you are under arrest!'
#TEXT   87

I didn't stay true to my promise and skipped Madam Botot's reception. I hope the governor will see his favor indulged anyway.
#TEXT   4
No rest for the wicked, as they say in the Book. The night of fun swiftly turned into another adventure. I cannot yet see real reasons behind all this, but it is high time I recall how to play cards before joining the other guests. I only wonder how big they consider big pays to be?
#TEXT   5
High society's distractions turn out to be too exquisite for me. I lost quite a sum and had to take my leave of shame. Well, I guess a parlor part of my life is gone for good.
#TEXT   6
A sweet night turned into some real drama. Betting ships and women - I  totally forgot how far high society can go.
Nevertheless, I won a war frigate of my new friend Angerran de Chievous. I also won a flute loaded with silver which our dear governor kind of forgot to sell to the Dutch. Finally, I won Marquise Julianne de Botot. From this moment I am a patron of a luxury, beautiful and well-connected courtesan who once was a lover of the most powerful man of New France - Count de Levy Vantadur. It's a complicated situation, even if we forget about an affection towards her shared by two men who I stripped of their ships tonight.
Oh and there is a matter of my duel against de Chievous. That bastard of Count de Levy Vantadur challenged me by publicly accusing me of cheating. I should go to the governor and discuss terms, but first I should thank Madam Botot for her hospitality. And to decide what to do with my... winnings.
#TEXT   7
De Chievous intends to put an end to our disagreements with a sword. The governor is terribly concerned over possible backfire. He put a lot of effort into persuading me not to kill the bastard and even assigned a couple of noble officers as my seconds. The duel will take place today, just outside the gates at ten o'clock in the evening. This is not great, even though Angerran will not be the first noble bastard to face me, he definitely knows how to hold his sword! It won't be an easy fight.
And now her! Now I start seeing how all of this looked like to her, especially after we had a fight on the street. She's got all the reasons in the world to be mad with me. If I win that duel, we are bound to have a very long talk.
#TEXT   8
The bastard proved to be tough, but not tough enough. Same as with cards, once he realized he was losing, he dropped his mask and honor. He fled and we were attacked by a group of his thugs. Lucky I had those officers with me. I wouldn't have made it without them. I should see the governor and report that as soon as possible.
#TEXT   9
De Chievous struck me hard after all! I worried about the wrong person. The bastard didn't go for her but instead, he captured his frigate, slaughtered my prize team, and abducted my woman. I don't know if she yet lives but I will do whatever it takes to find her! I must learn about de Chievous' whereabouts from the governor. This time I will not listen to his mumbling about 'consequences' and make sure his tongue is set to purpose!
#TEXT   10
Time is out. I will never see her again or hear about her fate. The fucking bastard knew where to strike me. I will live with this wound till the end of my days.
#TEXT   11
My darkest concerns came true. Angerran de Chievous did abduct my woman and left a letter proposing to meet him at Guadeloupe in ten days. According to Madam Botot, the governor will remain at his side meaning that I must be extremely cautious when dealing with the man. At least she yet lived! If he lays his hands on her I swear I tear Bass-Terre and its governor apart!
Damn me! I had no idea it was going to turn like this.
#TEXT   12
I can see the frigate in the harbor of Basse-Terre. Angerran doesn't care about hiding! But I can't fight him here. Even though I don't give a damn about what the governor thinks, a direct assault will put her in danger. The bastard might have hidden her elsewhere too. I have no other choice but to pay de Chievous a visit, hoping the governor will be reasonable enough.
#TEXT   13
No gunfight this time, but de Chievous cares only about Marquise de Botot. He would not be settled by any other ransom. He demands I hand her over to him in two weeks off cape Scotts Head. Like she is some precious trinket. I have no idea what to do about that. De Lyon believes Angerran to be a man of worth and even if I persuaded him otherwise, our hands will still be tied. The bastard is certain of his position, certain he will get away with anything. No! Why would he have me abduct Julianne Botot if he can do it himself? Because he can't. He fears something. I must go to Saint-Pierre and talk this through with the marquise! 
#TEXT   14
My hopes proved false. Marquise knows nothing useful to help me to retrieve my woman. I can't take any more chances here. I will have to follow de Chievous' instructions and pray for his sense of honor. So idiotic of me, right? I have no other option, but to sail to Dominica and I am sorry for those who will stand in my way.
#TEXT   15
I had to fight my way through, but made it in time. De Chievous' ship is anchored right ahead. Time to get a longboat ready. The time has come.
#TEXT   16
Finally! She is back in my arms! All ended well, mostly. I don't know what will happen to Madam Botot, but I don't regret the choice I made and would absolutely make the same choice again. I had more than a few revelations in the past weeks and now I know she is worth to me more than all the gold in the world. I will deal with all the backfire. Same old stuff, a bribe here, a favor there. In the end, I can always raise my black flag and sail to Isla Tesoro. I only wish I meet de Chievous again. We have got a score to settle...
#TEXT   17
This is surely getting impossible and overcomplicated. I met Baronet Cortney, who leaves an impression of a man with extreme official authority. He is looking for a lost currier vessel, the Regina. Lost somewhere deep in the territory of France, a trusted ally of Britain. The ship carried legendary black pearls, exactly like the pearl in the necklace, de Chievous gifted to Marquise Botot. He must have had something to do with the Regina's disappearance, this is probably my only chance to nail him hard! I must investigate further. Jacques the Kind won't tell me a thing, but the Baronet can actually make him talk. Tomorrow evening, in the Marquise's house, I will know for sure. Not much of a choice I have got here really.
#TEXT   18
I missed a meeting with Baronet Cortney, thus missing my only chance to get off de Chievous' hook. I know you wouldn't like it, but I have only one choice. I must get you back at any cost.

De Chievous is in deep and so am I. The story of the Regina and the stolen pearls she transported was all smoke and mirrors set by the Spanish themselves to sabotage the British-French alliance. Baronet Cortney agreed to lend me a hand after we fought through an assassination attempt organized by Jacques Barbason. He will accompany me to Dominica where we will arrest de Chievous' vessel. I just hope that Cortney is right and they will not try to resist. I am sorry for taking that risk, my dear, but I don't see the other way.
#TEXT   21
This is it, I guess. Baron Cortney arrested de Chievous' ship and now he is onto the man himself. I have no desire to see him again. From this moment, he is the State's problem, not mine. She is by my side again, she is alive and healthy, I couldn't hope for more! I love that woman and it's probably the right time to... Later, perhaps. We are together again and I am happy. I suppose I should thank Marquise Botot for help, however, I am sure she'd understand if I don't show up.
#TEXT   22
I heard an interesting story from Bartolomeo the Portuguese who is currently hiding in St. Pierre under the alias of Captain Moreno. It appears that Angerran de Chievous had something to do with an attack on the British brigantine transporting rare pearls stolen by privateers from Spanish. He was selling pearls to Jacques Barbason in order to get enough cash for his future gambling with the governor. He also tried to impress Marquise Botot with a luxury necklace ornamented with the rarest black pearl. Brits must be furious to find out their most precious pearls stolen, considering how extremely rare and expensive black pearls are. However, that will never do as firm evidence.
#TEXT   23
It's a poor plan but I don't see any way to return her without sacrificing Madam Botot. I will have to risk it. While Bart the Portuguese will be conducting the exchange at Dominica, I myself will go to Antigua to somehow persuade British authorities to trust my information. The bastard's frigate will probably make it from Dominica to Guadeloupe in three days, that's all the time I've got. My goal is to make the Brits suspend Angerran's vessel and search it through. The frigate's logs should have all the evidence they needed thanks to Angerran's pedantry. If it is a success, I am risking turning this whole operation into a massive political scandal. Alas, the bastard is leaving me with no other choice.
#TEXT   24
I had no idea of the real measure of British interest in this business. It is not even about the pearls. As far as I understand, the ship belonged to one of the infamous trading agents of the Empire. Spies, as they also call them. Now the Brits are eager to kill and rampage, to do everything it takes in order to learn who ratted that ship out. Otherwise, they are risking losing their entire spy network. It appears that de Chievous had no idea what he was getting himself into. Nevertheless, I won't stop even if I could. To Basse-Terre now! Baronet Courtney is about to turn the island upside down if it gets him to Angerran, but most importantly, he actually got all authority to do so. 
You must already be in Martinique. Things coming apart and yet, I can not stop thinking only of you. I managed to deliver the British investigator to Basse-Terre, hoping my guts were right and de Chievous didn't flee just yet. I should see the governor as soon as possible and make sure things go peacefully. Baronet Cortney will go all the hard way on any witness, while I need a quiet arrest of de Chievous, not a British Navy landing party in a French town.
#TEXT   25
It's over, I think. Sometimes we need to lose something before we can understand its value. Not everyone gets a chance to return what they lost. I was a lucky one. That woman... I knew I loved her, but I am starting to understand her true value to me only now. In the meantime, Barth didn't wait for me and fled from Martinique. I don't even need to read his farewell letter to know what really happened here. Some things never change - shadow games of Dukes and wars of Kings.

Abbot Benoit sent me a letter from my father and notarial papers.
So, my parent, through Benoit himself, has already learned about what had happened to Michel and, apparently, had time to put up with it. Damn it! I had to write to him myself!
And now he is determined to leave the de Monper family to me - not only making me the heir of a lean estate and a well-deserved family name, but also marrying a suitable girl. What's next? Please, give birth to the grandchildren?!
Even if Yvonne La Brigne was not as stupid as a cork, neither she nor any of the Gascony or Bordeaux vineyards in addition would make me give up the love that I found here in the New World! I can't imagine my life without @<sName>, but I can't go against the will of my father expressed in this tone.
There is only one way out - to meet with a venerable parent, the heir must already be married. Married for love and all the rules. And the gold that I earned here will reconcile my father with the lack of a dowry.
I don't know if @<sName> was waiting for this or not, but I will offer her a hand and a heart. In all honesty, it should have been done a long time ago. Only first, I need to think about it carefully.

Here are the first difficulties - Abbot Benoit went to negotiate with the Spanish clergy on church affairs, but his absence becomes too long and causes concern even for other priests. It is possible that the holy father got into trouble, so I have to hurry - I'm going to search. In Santiago, I may find out something about the meeting of the clergy, cause Father Palotty, the prelate inquisitor, is one of the negotiators.
#TEXT   5
So, here is Santiago. I'm not sure that I will be a welcomed guest in the Inquisition, so I'll start with questions in the city. As far as I know, the meeting of the spiritual pastors of the two warring countries is official, which means they must be gossiped about at every corner.
#TEXT   6
I managed to find out that Abbot Benoit with his delegation is still in Santiago. Negotiations clearly dragged on, and the holy father in the evenings serves a prayer in the local church. This is my chance to speak with him without further questions and 'honorable guard'.
#TEXT   7
I have no time and desire to unravel the church intrigues of the Spaniards. Father Benoit will have to be relieved of his duties as an honored guest simply and radically. And the prelate inquisitor... well, this is not the first time that our interests do not coincide. The Lord teaches us humility not for nothing.
#TEXT	8
I rescued Abbot Benoit from Santiago. I don't think that father-inquisitor has become a little warmer with me because of this story. Rather, exactly the opposite.
But the work has been done and it remains for me to deliver the abbot to Martinique.

I need to take her there and grab: @<sGoods>
I hope this will be enough. However, if the drink is over - I can always go to the sea and ... Fine, I hope this will not come to that. But I have to talk with Father Benoit and choose the guests who will be present at the official part in the church.

Frankly speaking, I would have easier to bear half a dozen boarding parties, but this day should have come, and I am grateful to fate that my chosen one is @<sName>, and not some 'worthy candidate' with a couple of vineyards per soul. Marriage for love is a rarity, and for mutual love is a rarity priceless.
Yes, I am happy, and my father will have to accept my choice.

The celebration among friends turned into a bloody massacre. Jacques the Kindman seized the opportunity, gathered his strength, and is trying once and for all to get rid of most of the barons of the Brethren. He offended Sharptown from land and from the sea. The landing group, making its way to the town through the catacombs, we noticed on time and were able to fight back. Svenson, Tyrex, and the rest went aboard, trying to hold back Barbason's squadron, Hawk and I searched for Dannie and @<sName>. 
Angerran de Chievous himself is in alliance with Barbason,  - he led the strike group on land, intending to solve our 'disagreements' with me. Hawk and I found a bastard in the residence - he kept our wives at gunpoint, and @<sName1> covered them from shot and got a bullet. He remained alive by a miracle, but he's very bad - he lost a lot of blood and without the help of Gino will unlikely manage to survive.
But where to look for Gino in Sharptown, which turned into a battlefield? There is a battle in the harbor and every minute is counted - the vessels of the barons only with watchmen on board fight with clearly superior forces. I should go to the sea as soon as possible and support them, until everyone is killed there.

#QUEST IslaMona
A Place to Call Home
#TEXT   1
The crazy idea popped into my head - to turn my Isla Mona into something more than a deserted pirate nest in the heart of the Caribbean. My steadfast 'governor' Rodgar didn't appreciate the idea, but at least he suggested what needs to be done. The first step will be to find high-quality tools and some very special settlers. As for the tools, it's clear - I'll talk to the shipyard masters. But the settlers... No one in their right mind will agree to participate in the building of who knows what, where, and under whose flag! And it all has to be done in complete secrecy, without the right to return to civilization for the next few years. I won't bring slaves there! I'll start with tools, and then take it from there. I'm not pressed for time with this task. Or maybe I should just forget about it?
#TEXT   2
I bought a set of high-quality European tools for a hefty sum. Typically, colonies are established with the use of such a set, but personally, I think it should practically build itself for the price I paid! Now, let's brighten Rodgar's day.

It seems that only after seeing the tools, Rodgar finally believed in the seriousness of my intentions. Now, finding colonists is the next step. Easier said than done...
#TEXT   3-1
Rumor has it, a group of people has landed on an uninhabited island. I need to try to find them-perhaps they can be useful in my plan. And if not, they can at least pay me for their rescue.
#TEXT   4
I rescued a group of Spanish refugees from the bleak fate they were facing. It appears they haven't yet fully realized the irony of the situation: from one deserted island, they are now being transported to another. Regardless, neither I nor they have much of a choice. I need colonists, and they have nowhere else to turn. Hopefully, something worthwhile will come out of this peculiar alliance.
#TEXT   5
I introduced Rodgar to Jimenez, the leader of the refugees. Tomorrow, I should meet with both of them and hear their proposals for building the settlement.
#TEXT   6
Jimenez clearly knows his craft and has taken up the construction with great zeal. After all, this will be his home. That's why I wasn't surprised when he suggested first bringing the settlement to a more civilized state and rebuilding the shacks into proper houses. The list of necessary goods is impressive, and I think it will only grow in the future. All the goods that I ship here I will need to unload in the warehouse. I'll go talk to Rodgar - he needs to thoroughly explore the island. It turns out we know very little about Isla Mona.
#TEXT   7
Rodgar surprised me quite a bit! He and his guys asked for gold for their services - a whopping six hundred full-weight gold coins! I didn't protest; in the end, all good work must be rewarded, and the development of this base is exclusively my whim.
Additionally, I need to bring the first-necessity supplies for our guests from Europe. 2000 units of food and 300 medicines must be delivered to the warehouse.
#TEXT   8
Rodgar surprised me quite a bit! He and his guys asked for gold for their services - a whopping six hundred full-weight gold coins! Naturally, I refused them. If they want to live on my island with comfort, they better damn well put some work into it. And besides, why would they need money on a remote island? In any case, the reconnaissance of the island can be considered a resolved matter.
Now I just need to bring the first-necessity supplies for our guests from Europe. 
2000 units of food and 300 medicines must be delivered to the warehouse.

Well, that's it-construction is in full swing! I sure hope I did not haul all these planks and bricks here for nothing. A lot of money and time has been spent, so it's better for Rodgar and Jimenez to make the most of the next six months.
#TEXT   13
The settlement has transformed! And definitely for the better! Not quite La Vega, of course, but still, I'm proud! Onward and upward: Rodrigo has outlined a detailed plan for the ongoing construction. I need to study it and make a decision. The ironwood factory will help recoup investments quickly, but a tavern with a pier will also bring considerable benefits.
#TEXT   14
Isla Mona has transformed. It is now both a substantial military base in a strategically advantageous location and a lucrative enterprise. But Rodrigo had another 'pleasant' surprise in store for me. It turns out he and his community have a very interesting past. You don't get dropped off on an uninhabited island for no reason! I don't know what concerns me more: that they are heretics and criminals, or that he lied to me. Or maybe I don't care at all? In any case, if I decide that I fully trust and accept Jimenez and his people, I need to bring a bunch of materials to build a church. And not a typical Christian church at that! Ha! A damn expensive 'sign of trust' it turns out to be!
#TEXT   15
The decision is made - a church it is! Rodrigo was overjoyed, and I was a bit moved. In two months, the construction on Isla Mona will officially be completed, and I am invited to attend a celebration in its honor.

Preposterous. Near Isla Mona, a naval battle took place, ending very poorly for both sides. The survivors ended up on my island and rightly assumed they found a pirate's nest. For now, everyone is in a tense standoff and hesitates to attack each other. The situation is at an impasse, so I was sent for reconnaissance and negotiations with the 'bandits.' It would be a suicidal mission if they weren't MY bandits.

What a day! Just outside the settlement, I unexpectedly encountered one of Rodgar's pirates walking towards the soldiers with raised hands. The tranquil evening quickly turned chaotic with gunfire ensuing. It seems this now dead fool held a grudge over unpaid doubloons. On the bright side, my island is now rid of intruders. Time to head to the settlement.
#TEXT   20_1
It turns out that my fellow countrymen were the enemies. It's regrettable, of course, that it came to this, but I won't allow anyone to brazenly invade my island. I need to check on how things are with Rodgar and Rodrigo in the settlement. Hopefully, they managed to organize a defense.

I met with my own people. Thank God, everyone is unharmed. It's time to end this mess, and that means forcing the enemy to launch a suicidal attack on the gates.

The issue with the Spanish captain has been resolved. I hope I won't regret my decision. But I believe that this highly honorable man will keep his word. I will drop him off on the deserted beach near the Santiago lighthouse.

The Grandee de Alba has been saved, and I gained a powerful friend. Although, perhaps, it's just comforting for me to think so.

Rumba
#TEXT 1
It seems I'm in for an extraordinary adventure with a lovely lady in the leading role. Before setting sail for Cartagena, it's only proper to meet and introduce myself. She did ask to pay her a visit after all.
#TEXT 2
Oh, how right my brother was about the local ladies! Rumba knows how to party and she is truly an amazing young woman. Mature beyond her years, a born sailor-far superior to me. Despite her openness last night, I couldn't shake the feeling that complex and conflicting emotions were overwhelming her throughout the evening. That's only natural given what she's recently been through.
Honestly, I'm already quite taken with her, although I'm not sure if my feelings are mutual or even appropriate.
#TEXT 3
I wonder why Svenson actually entrusted his precious Rumba to me? It would have been safer to keep her at his home, or better yet, locked inside the fort of Blueweld. The sea holds many dangers, and entrusting her to a stranger like me seems unnecessarily risky.
Either Svenson knows more than he's letting on, or it was Elen herself who requested this. In any case, she and I have a significant task ahead, and it makes sense to establish a working relationship at the very least. I'll take her to Isla Tesoro and show her the inheritance. It's risky, but I hope it will thaw the ice that seems to be between us.
#TEXT 4
It was a foolish idea. I seem to have forgotten how to court women entirely: Helen clearly didn't fancy Isla Tesoro, and the cold, empty mansion of her "uncle's" with a pile of bodies at the doorstep certainly didn't improve her mood.
Nevertheless, the endeavor did yield some results. I realized that Miss Sharp is burdened by the situation with the unexpected inheritance that fell on her, and she is still grieving over the recent tragic loss of her ship and crew.
Helen is seeking her new place in this world, and she is troubled by the loss of control over her destiny. And especially by the fact that she has become a pawn in the hands of the powerful of this world, including, haha, me. Nobody asked her about it, just like nobody asked me back in Saint-Pierre on October 1, 1654.
I genuinely want to help her.
#TEXT 5
The hero's return from the Isle of Justice will be remembered for a long time. I must confess, I was completely caught up in the whirlwind of events and intrigues of this unnatural place. So much so that I completely forgot about Helen. But she hasn't forgotten me.
Her unexpected, awkward, yet sincere and genuine kiss completely took me by surprise and shattered the haughty demeanor of Daniel, who has seen it all.
What a wonderful girl! Damn it, how delightful it is to be awaited at home!

#TEXT 6
I will never tire of saying that Helen is a true marvel. Just when I was ready to implode and vent all my accumulated frustration at the Brotherhood, she, the first among this pirate merry company, offered her assistance. Real assistance, expressed not in kind words but in cold, hard coin.
I understand that her fate is also being decided right now, but I'm very pleased nonetheless.
We're heading to San Juan del Norte - somewhere nearby is the cave where Helen has hidden the "borrowed" goods from Svenson. Clever, to say the least. Bravo, Miss Sharp!

Shame that Helen clearly isn't impressed with my actions.

Soon, everything will be resolved and I am looking forward to it.

Vile Little God
#TEXT 1
An event happened today - so ridiculous that I can't help but feel a sense of its artificiality. Having originally stopped by the brothel of Panama for purposes of business, I spent the next few hours getting drunk, playing cards and dice with an actual Indian chief! Not only did he speak incredibly well, was European educated and dressed, but he had managed to rent the brothel for a month for personal use! Even in this crazy world there are limits to insanity, and right now I felt like I was the victim of an idiotic prank.
Agueybana was talking nonsense about gods and wish-fulfillment, and at the end of the drink he handed me a pile of adder stones and told me to look for a temple on the mainland. Supposedly it is possible to open this temple by bringing one hundred and thirteen of these stones to its doors.
Nonsense, of course, but the native didn't look like a man capable of idiotic jokes - it was more likely that someone had played a very cruel joke on him. Why not check it out?
#TEXT 2
I wonder if this is the temple Agueybana was talking about. I'll have to try and find enough rocks to check for sure. Sounds moronic, of course.... Just as long as the crew doesn't get wind of what I'm actually doing here!
#TEXT 3
The damn bag burst open and the adder stones scattered down the steps to the ground! The scene must have been comical, because I could quite clearly hear laughter coming from the pyramid. I'm going in to say hi.
#TEXT 4
My collection of adder stones has left me, and in a very strange way too!
The bag burst open right on the steps of an abandoned pyramid on the mainland. The scene must have been comical, because I could clearly hear laughter coming from the pyramid. I'm going in to say hi.
#TEXT 5
The mishap at the brothel doesn't seem so funny anymore, and Agueybana's story is downright terrifying. The pyramid is indeed inhabited by a certain Aruba, whom the Indians apparently regard as one of their pagan gods and the good Christians as a common devil. 
In any case, Aruba offered me a deal - I should pay two thousand gold doubloons to make him take me seriously, and then some amazing rewards should follow. In general, this approach is familiar to everyone and is no different from the Church - only the amount of the initial fee is upsetting.
I also received four small tasks, which I can do in any order, or not at all. Perhaps I should start with these to see if it makes sense to get involved at all?
#TEXT 5.1
Alle Hagel! Despite all the loud claims, heresy is still blooming in the wilderness! In the pyramid, it turns out, a certain Aruba has taken up residence, whom the Indians apparently consider one of their pagan gods and the good Christians consider a common devil. 
Anyway, Aruba offered me a deal - I should pay two thousand gold doubloons to make him take me seriously, and then some amazing rewards should follow. In general, this approach is familiar to everyone and is no different from the Church, only the amount of the initial fee is upsetting.
I also received four small tasks that I can do or not do in any order. Perhaps I should start with them to see if it makes sense for me to get involved at all?
#TEXT 6
The doubloons are paid and in return a clay figurine of the Taino people from Aruba. Quite a useful item, though its value certainly pales in comparison to the mountain of gold I just gave for it. Now I have 15 mangarosa plants to collect - a troublesome endeavor!
#TEXT 7
Aruba got the herbs he asked for and in return he has lavished me with a very decent armament set. The next task is to bring him a whole ship. And not just any ship, but one with a history. I don't see a pier nearby, so I am curious where he'd put her.
#TEXT 8
I should have expected something like this!. A ship wasn't enough, now Aruba needs not only more gold, but blood too. I can probably manage three thousand doubloons, but a blood sacrifice is no joke. I have an important choice to make, and I have to decide for myself: is the promised power worth the price?
#TEXT 9
I did it. The price has been paid and, if the Church is right, hell awaits me. Somehow that doesn't scare me. A strange and very right feeling... Anyway, Aruba need one more sacrifice or twenty-five thousand doubloons.
There is no going back, I can only stop or go all the way.
#TEXT 10
The deed is done. Aruba is finally leaving the pyramid where he apparently locked himself in. I should probably search for a parting gift, which would be very much in the spirit of this strange creature.

Hopefully that's not a ploy orchestrated by Levasseur! If he has outwitted me, then the whole operation is doomed, a year's worth of preparations is wasted and I am done.

Hercule is gravely injured! Could this entire arrest be a smokescreen for an assassination attempt? I must do something and escape before it's too late.
#TEXT 3.1
Looks like there's no clean getaway for Hercule. I was partially correct: the reason behind the arrest is indeed linked to my endeavors in Tortuga, but the objective was not to disrupt my operation; rather, it was to eliminate a specific member of my crew. Thankfully, the commandant is on our side; he agreed to aid Hercule and secure my release. He seemed hesitant regarding the former though, so if Hercule survives - we will have a talk. It's time to leave Tortuga and postpone our operation for the time being.

The сommandant divulged some crucial information about the assassination attempt: it appears they are located somewhere on the mainland. Given the meticulous planning involved, it appears to be the work of a highly organized group. This all feels oddly familiar...
#TEXT 3.3
Could this arrest be connected to de Poincy's political maneuver against Levasseur? I am still in the dark about my next steps. Clearly, the Huguenot himself is not responsible for our recent troubles, at least not at this point. Thank heavens for French corruption - the commandant has agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for a modest contribution to the Tortuga garrison. Off to the bank I go.
#TEXT 4
I've left the prison behind, narrowly escaping a dire fate! I swear, there won't be a third time - I'd rather end myself instead. We can't afford to waste any more time; we must aid Hercule and then address the big problem.

I was overly optimistic. We've been ambushed by an unknown enemy, a highly skilled one at that, who initiated the battle with cunning tactics. We have no choice but to engage and survive.
#TEXT 6
Bloody, but victorious! Hercule came back to life at a crucial moment and even managed to turn my cabin into a gruesome display, adorned with the lifeless bodies of the masked assailants who boldly boarded our ship. Following our conversation, the situation has become somewhat clearer: he is being pursued by his former employer also known as the League - a military division of the Dutch West India Company's intelligence department, which also had connections with the 'secret organization' I once worked for.
Frankly, his tale doesn't quite add up; it's hard to believe any organization would go to such extremes to avenge one man. Nonetheless, we have little choice but to inflict substantial damage upon them until their pursuit becomes untenable, causing them to abandon their quest for revenge. I hope this will suffice; the last thing I need right now is another enemy.
#TEXT 7
Today has been a harrowing day, marked by a sea of corpses. I am starting to see the pattern here: a tidal wave of blood follows Hercule and me everywhere. These men slaughtered a hundred innocent lives. What for? To safeguard their gold? To send a message?
What's even more unsettling is that, for once, this bloodshed isn't solely my doing. It flows because of one man, whose dead eyes started to unnerve me recently. The most chilling part is that he's part of my crew, and that can only mean one thing: I face some agonizing choices ahead.
#TEXT 7.1
Another conversation with Tonzag, even harder for me than the previous one. He had been evasive with me from the start, and I doubt he revealed the whole truth even now.
Tonzag didn't just attempt to leave the League; he betrayed them in a cynical and blood-soaked manner. From what I've gathered today, the Los Teques mine isn't the bloodiest chapter in the history of this man with the disfigured, dead face.
As I suspected, I'm left with a monumental decision: to conclude this chapter in Caracas, risking further bloodshed, or simply walk away, knowing I might be betrayed at the worst possible moment someday. I believe I have a month to make this choice; after that, the League will likely depart Caracas.
My former victories against the Dutch and English are catching up to me. Time to face the consequences.
#TEXT 8
Tonzag is dead. He desired it that way, and I couldn't bring myself to deny him. The expected bloodshed never transpired: only he met his end today, and in truth, he had been dead inside for a long while. Or maybe it's easier for me to think that way.
Hercule Tonzag, the living dead and my most trusted vanguard - may you find peace and redemption. Farewell, my friend.

I am sorry for feeling a sense of joy upon witnessing the faint glimmer of life in the eyes of my most loyal vanguard.

Why do these kinds of coincidences always happen to me? Just as Charlie and I wanted to wet our whistles and take a break from the heat of the road, we were attacked in the tavern. The most interesting part was that the troublemaker's attention wasn't even on me but on Charlie. 
I understand that he's just as much a living person as anyone else, who might be liked or disliked by someone, but this is the first time I can remember someone targeting one of my crew instead of me. It's probably worth finding the lock that fits the key I found in that scoundrel's pocket.
#TEXT   2
A drunken brawl in a tavern seems like a regular occurrence, happening somewhere every day. But as it turned out later, this time was not quite usual. After Charlie dealt with the scoundrel, he found a key in his pocket. Remembering the innkeeper's words that the man had recently moved near the tavern, we decided to find his house, thinking it was the key to it. In reality, things turned out even more interesting. 
The hut was open, and the key fit a locked chest. Inside were some money, not much by itself, but quite a lot for someone dressed like a typical drunkard. Besides the money, I also found a burnt letter in the chest. Unfortunately, nothing could be deciphered from it - neither the content nor the recipient. Was it an irrelevant coincidence, or is a storm gathering upon us once again?

What a thing - to challenge someone to a duel and then ask someone else to fight it for you. Bold move, to say the least. Is there any honor in such a "matter of honor"? A man named Peter Adams approached me with such a request.
It turned out that in broad daylight, right in front of him and his neighbors, a local drunk named Ralph Faggle harassed his wife, Jane. Peter had no choice but to challenge him to a duel. However, he's unable to fight due to a recent fever. If it weren't for the lady's honor, I would have surely refused. But before I could even respond, Charlie made the decision for me because Adams mentioned he once served in the English Royal Navy and was on board with the legendary Admiral Blake. 
Now I have to fight on Peter's behalf in a duel in a couple of hours just outside the city. I'm not against helping those in need who deserve it. But I need to have a serious talk with Charlie afterwards, to make sure he never makes decisions for me again.
#TEXT   4
Today, a man who once served in the English Royal Navy asked for my help. Peter Adams claims he once sailed with Admiral Blake, a hero of the English Revolution and the "liberator" of Jamaica from Spanish rule.
Recently, Adams has faced one misfortune after another - first, he suffered from a severe fever, and then, while he was still recovering, a local named Ralph Faggle harassed his wife Jane right in front of him and his neighbors, leading Peter to challenge Ralphto a duel despite his condition. Although all this seems a bit suspicious, I agreed to help these people because there is always a chance that you are helping a person in real need rather than a fraudster. Adams' wife confirmed every word, despite clearly not expecting to see us at her home. There's still about two hours left until the duel, which will take place just outside the city gates.
Old Charlie "wouldn't stoop so low," huh? It's so easy to provoke the man. He lived so many years and still doesn't understand that there's nothing low about simple caution. My caution suggests that it might not hurt to talk to the neighbors if there's time - maybe their perspective on what happened will be different. However, I don't think it's really necessary - this isn't my first duel, and I'm sure it won't be my last, even if Ralph cheats somehow.
#TEXT   5
Neighbors are full of shit as always. A good neighbour, Ralph Faggle himself, told me many interesting things. He's a mercenary, just like Peter Adams. And their target wasn't me but Charlie. I realized this from the letter I found on Adams' body - it described Charlie in great detail. And his house had money, just like that tavern incident a month ago.
I had to press Charlie a bit to get him to share his thoughts. He once borrowed money from a moneylender in St. John's with no no intention to repay it. Not out of spite, but because Richard Fleetwood promised to do it for him. Could it be that he didn't keep his promise before leaving the Caribbean? That's what we need to find out now.
#TEXT   6
I've heard stories about moneylenders sending bounty hunters after runaway debtors, but this case goes beyond any limits. This is the second time in a row that people are hunting Charlie, we kill them and then find letters and gold chests in their homes afterwards. This time, though, the letter was intact and described Charlie's appearance in great detail. Who attacked him this time? The honorable gentleman Peter Adams! And Ralph Faggle turned out to be his accomplice. 
Charlie believes this is revenge from the moneylender in St. John's - some time ago, he borrowed money from him. Richard Fleetwood stepped in to repay the unlucky cannoneer's debt. Apparently, he never did. Figures...
#TEXT   7
So, we're approaching St. John's. Considering the measures the moneylender dared to take to punish Charlie for his debts, we need to move around the city with great caution.
#TEXT   8
If mercenaries and bounty hunters fail, you can always try to do everything by the book. As soon as we docked at the port of St. John's, we got a warm welcome and Charlie was arrested. I didn't complicate the situation for him or myself, so I let the soldiers take him away. At least they didn't try to grab me too, so I can still try to sort this out. I need to hurry and pay a courtesy visit to the moneylender in case they plan to hang Charlie.
#TEXT   9
It's amazing how moneylenders can be ruthless and merciless to their debtors, draining their blood to the last drop, yet tremble with fear at the slightest threat to themselves, like a dog on a cold night. And although it turned out that this moneylender wasn't involved in Charlie's troubles, and Fleetwood did repay his debt, it doesn't honor either of them. As soon as I applied a little pressure, he called for the guards, and I had to start a massacre right in the bank. I'll need to post bail for Charlie at the prison commandant's office.
#TEXT   10
Whoever Charlie crossed paths with, they got to him. Right in the St. John's jail. Building various hypotheses and trying to dig further is pointless - if only because it won't bring Knipple back from the dead. Maybe I shouldn't have let Charlie be arrested at all, but given the events of recent months, I suspect that this mysterious someone, who has English lawmen in their pocket, wouldn't have given up and would have taken what they wanted in the end anyway.
#TEXT   11
I've got answers to two questions, but things haven't gotten any easier. First - Fleetwood did repay Charlie's debt before leaving the Caribbean. And, therefore, second - the moneylender didn't dispatch bounty hunters. So, I'll have to bow to the commandant and post bail for Charlie. Or bribe him. All the same to my wallet.
#TEXT   12
I met someone from the famous Sea Foxes, a marine of the British Navy. In my professional opinion, they're somewhat overrated and not much different in battle from the mercenaries we've encountered before. I had to free Charlie from jail by force, barely reaching his cell before that Sea Fox sent him to the afterlife. "Best regards from the Sussex"... What could that mean? I think Charlie knows something - there was more sadness than surprise in his eyes when he heard that name. We'll talk thoroughly once we're out of here.
#TEXT   13
We arrived in St. John's in the middle of the night, and I think that's for the best. After all, during the day, if the conversation with the moneylender doesn't go as planned, he can call the guards, and we'll be surrounded by almost the entire garrison of the island in a matter of minutes. The problem is that the bank is closed at night, and Charlie doesn't know exactly where the owner lives now. Searching by trial and error is out of the question - we'll wake and scare people and attract attention. It would be good to ask someone who knows everything and everyone in the city but won't suspect us for such a question. Especially at this time of night.
#TEXT   14
God bless drunkards of the Caribbean! At any tavern, day or night, you can find a not-too-bright drunkard. Sit with him, buy him a drink or two, tell him you're friends now, and his loose tongue will be completely at our service. 
Fleetwood's death might be a terrible, but still, a coincidence, with his enemies being his and Charlie's being his own. I decided not to ask the innkeeper where the moneylender lives. It's pointless during the day, as the bank is open, and asking at night would only arouse suspicion. So instead, the knight of rum and wine talked and told me that the banker is currently residing in Fleetwood's former house. Funny.
#TEXT   15
Fleetwood might not have been as bad a person as Charlie emotionally described when we read Richard's farewell letter. The moneylender confirmed that he kept his promise and fully repaid all of Charlie's debts. At first, of course, like anyone else in his position, he was somewhat... frightened by my appearance in his house at that time, but I managed to calm him down and avoid unnecessary noise. So, we worried for nothing - it's unlikely anyone is hunting Charlie here, in a colony so familiar and almost dear to him. We can safely return to the ship and think about where to dig next.
#TEXT   16
This is no longer just a tangled web but a deep and damn dirty quagmire. Charlie, who once served in the Royal Navy and is generally a decent person, is being hunted by his compatriots. As soon as we left the banker's house, we were met by soldiers lead by a marine, a Sea Fox, who delivered Charlie "best regards from the Sussex." But despite the message, it wasn't a meeting with Sussex that awaited us, not an arrest - but an execution without trial or investigation. Charlie and I need to have a serious talk.
#TEXT   17
I summoned Charlie to the cabin, and he told me the story of the Sussex. As soon as we finished talking, the guys burst in and reported that a light warship was approaching us. English colors. It's... the Mirage. How is this even possible?..

Some people think their titles and positions will always protect them. Wrong! Strong fuck weak. I taught this humiliating but deserved lesson to Colonel Thomas Lynch - the man behind all those attacks. He achieved a lot: burnt down the Sussex with Fleetwood's hands, recreated the Mirage by obtaining the original blueprints and eliminated almost all witnesses, including Fleetwood himself. 
However, his luck ended with me, as all attempts to kill Charlie shattered like waves against an unbreakable rock, the one my father always wanted me to be. Lynch smugly said that I can't touch him because then the entire English fleet would hunt me? Fine. I didn't even lay a finger on him as he flew out of the window of his own cabin. I hope this is the last lesson I have to teach him. In any case, he'll remember it for a very long time. And even if the colonel never calms down, the fleet will eventually give up on us. So we can enjoy our freedom again.
#TEXT   19
Life really isn't a fairytale, and you can't always save everyone. But today, I managed. The attacker was Colonel Thomas Lynch. He was behind all of this from the beginning. Everything - destroying the Sussex with Fleetwood's hands, then destroying Fleetwood himself as an unwanted witness, and later - the attacks on us and Charlie. He even sought the blueprints for the Mirage and perfected the original design. What a resourceful man!
This time, he personally came for Charlie, and... again he got what he wanted. In a way. I managed to persuade the colonel to find a similar body and show it to his colleagues instead of Charlie because they demanded a corpse. Fortunately, he agreed, but for a monumental bribe. So I paid another million because killing Lynch would have brought England's wrath upon us. Acted like a true captain - protected myself and my crew. Let's hope the colonel can fool his colleagues - and he will, I am sure of that.

A warship, new, improved, with the flaws of its predecessor corrected... A prize to betray for. Charlie's nemesis had a name. Thomas Lynch - a colonel who previously gave Fleetwood the task of eliminating the Sussex and then decided to eliminate Fleetwood and all the witnesses of that mission. Lynch also managed to obtain the Dutch plans and build his own ketch. My ketch. And no, I didn't kill Lynch - he clearly let me know that if it happened, the English would continue to hunt us to the bitter end. For them, it was a real victory - I handed them Charlie to make it all stop. The prospect of fending off English military intelligence until old age or facing the gallows doesn't suit me. I am sorry, Charlie...

Such a person is Colonel Thomas Lynch - the one who gave Fleetwood the task to get rid of the Sussex, and later got rid of Richard himself. Previously, Lynch successfully obtained the original plans for the Mirage, then English shipbuilders perfected them, and we faced the result of their work. I decided that keeping such a person as an enemy is too dangerous, so I handed Charlie over to the colonel. He didn't deserve to die. But neither did I. At least now, I can collect the promised reward from Lynch - in Port Royal, at the moneylender's. A pile of gold with a scent of silver.

The english ship "Chimera", which outwardly resembled the "Mirage", sank to the bottom. I have a strange feeling that it was the captain of the Chimera who was involved in the recent attack on Charlie. Now Charlie can breathe easy, but we will no longer be able to find out the reason for the hunt for Charlie.

Usually, my officers request either a raise or permanent leave due to frustration with life at sea. But today, of all people, Longway asked for leave. Thankfully, not permanent. Unfortunately, he didn't provide a reason - only mentioning a long-standing promise and an oath he couldn't discuss. Of course, I let him go - after all, I'm bound to the Archipelago by a promise too. A vow to help my brother, who was taken from me by our father. We agreed to meet in Basse-Terre in a month's time. Once Longway has finished his business, he'll wait for me there for another week or so.
#TEXT   2
What was I thinking? Just a few days ago, Longway wanted to leave my ship, and I wouldn't let him. Now he's run away, leaving a sad farewell letter in my quarters. I got angry because he wouldn't tell me where he was going or why. Maybe things would have turned out differently if I'd offered my help without asking too many questions - then I might have learned everything along the way. I need to treat my men better, especially the best and most honorable among them. I hope he completes his mission and that I see him again one day.
#TEXT   3
I didn't have to look long to find Longway. He'd already become something of a legend around here, and the tavern drunks were talking about his skill with a blade. When the guards questioned him about what he was doing in the city, he massacred them - first in the city, then in the jungle, where he turned a cave into a fortress and defended it against soldiers sent by the commandant. What the hell are you doing, Longway? It looks like I'll have to have a tough talk with the commandant to get them to stop hunting him. But what if he's fighting off another squad right now...?
#TEXT   4
Damn it! I've been dragged to that pompous commandant while I should have run straight to the cave. I wanted to smooth things over and ensure a safe retreat for both me and Longway. Of course, all I got was getting arrested and Longway killed. At least I'm free again, but I'll never know what oath Longway swore, or to whom. Or what he needed the pages from van Merden's archives for. He tore them out and kept them with him until the end.
#TEXT   5
My worst fears were realized - a conversation with the commandant yielded nothing but deaths. He was furious that he couldn't catch Longway, and when I revealed that I was his friend, he turned that fury on me. Our conversation reached an impasse, and he decided to arrest me. Bad for him.
I have to hurry and run for the cave as fast as I can before the whole island is up in arms because of negotiations I have failed.
#TEXT   6
I was forced to leave Guadeloupe. As much as I felt sorry for Longway, the lives of all the other men, the ship as a whole, and, for that matter, my own, outweighed the bottom line. I had to leave him to his fate. I am sorry.
#TEXT   7
What was I thinking?! I should have rushed into the jungle to rescue Longway as soon as possible. The commandant wasted no time in sending another unit after our quarrel - maybe even more than one. But no - I panicked and ran back to the ship, moving it to another bay, even though it was already in a safe place. It wasn't until we hoisted the sails and turned around that I realized what I had done. It's too late to turn back now. Poor Longway... If I'm going to run, it's time to leave the island's waters. I'll have to try to forget this day.
#TEXT   8
Oh, it's bad enough when other people's actions turn someone against you in advance... I arrived in Basse-Terre, but Longway was nowhere to be found in town. I asked the innkeeper about it, but he refused to tell me anything, claiming that “yellows” weren't welcome in his establishment. It was a convenient excuse, but I could tell he knew something. I decided to continue my search on my own, but the soldiers found me first. As soon as I hit the streets, I was surrounded and taken to the commandant. When he learned that Longway was my officer, he became hostile to me immediately. It turned out my faithful navigator had cut down many guards when they tried to question him about the purpose of his visit - both in the city and the jungle. I tried to suggest a solution, but the commandant was beyond reasoning. I was arrested, which seemed better than being drawn into a conflict with the whole city garrison. As a result, Longway was pinned down in the cave and didn't survive the fight. Fortunately, the commandant released me immediately afterward. On Longway's body, they found several bloody sheets from van Merden's archives. I wonder why Longway needed them. However, there's no way of knowing that now...
#TEXT   9
Why, why didn't you accept my help, Longway? And why did I somehow think I had to do everything myself? I was only a little late, so now you are dead. When I got to Basse-Terre, I thought at first that you were gone and I'd have to search the Archipelago for you. I didn't have to. The innkeeper either forgot all about it or didn't want to talk about it. But the commandant did, and he summoned me to explain. They have found crumpled, bloody pages from Johan van Merden's archives on your body. What use are they now? It doesn't matter anymore.
#TEXT   10
My worst fears were realized - a conversation with the commandant yielded nothing but deaths. He was furious that he couldn't catch Longway, and when I revealed that I was his friend, he turned that fury on me. Our conversation reached an impasse, and he decided to arrest me. Bad for him.
I'll have to get back to the ship and hoist the sails immediately - given what happened, it's going to be riddled with fort guns while I search for my poor navigator. I am so sorry, Longway...
#TEXT   11
Why didn't you listen to me? We've known each other for so long - did you really believe I would attack you? Or did you just lose your nerve? When I walked ahead of the soldiers to talk to Longway and calm both him and the guards, he thought I was with them and attacked us. If we had fought one-on-one, I might have gotten through to him. But the soldiers had their excuse, and there was no stopping them. I had to kill Longway with them. He was carrying the torn, crumpled, and bloody pages of Johan van Merden's archive. So, Longway was the one who tore them out from under my nose all along... Bad news one after another, damn it. At least the town has no more claims on me, and I can finally leave. I guess I won't be coming back here for a very long time.
#TEXT   12
I don't even know what went wrong for you, Longway. Was it fatigue? A poor parry? Lack of skill at the last moment? Whatever the case, when I finally reached you and helped fight off the soldiers, you took your last breath right then. And though the sheets in your pockets were hopelessly drenched in blood, I recognized them as... torn pages from van Merden's archives. What did you want them for? There's no way of knowing now. It doesn't matter anymore - all I can do now is return to the ship.
#TEXT   13
Even though the soldiers tried to stop us, I got my navigator out of the jungle without causing another massacre. But let's not push our luck - it's time to hoist the sails before anyone on the island changes their mind again.
#TEXT   14
These are insane and bloody times on Guadeloupe. Earlier, Longway made a bloodbath of the island, slaughtering guards in the town and defending against them at a cave in the jungle. Now it's me, fighting shoulder to shoulder with him against two squads of soldiers - one after the other. The good news is that it's all behind us for now, and we need to get off the island. Any delay could be fatal.
#TEXT   15
Despite Longway not being able to reach the Morning Star on his own, his search wasn't entirely in vain. The captain of the brig Banten, still lingering in Guadeloupe waters, appears to be connected to that mysterious heavy galleon. They docked at the lighthouse, and several crew members went ashore. Was the captain among them? We can't attack the ship right now, as the captain might hide in the city. So, we'll head there on foot. Considering recent events, the safety of my ship is also a concern, so it's high time we leave the port and move to Capster Beach.
#TEXT   16
The wind betrayed us, and securing our ship took so long that we eventually watched the Banten disappear over the horizon. I don't know how I'll face Longway now...
#TEXT   17
I haven't seen a ship this fast in a long time - not since I worked for Rodenburg. We made it to the lighthouse in time, but unfortunately, we didn't catch the man we sought. Inside, we found the Commandant and none other than Joep van der Vink, one of the men involved in the kidnapping of Longway's sister. Longway was certain he had killed Joep back in Batavia a decade ago. As I feared, these scoundrels spotted us when we tried to eavesdrop on their conversation. And while we fought off the Commandant and van der Vink's men, Joep escaped the island in his brig. We must flee too - but not in pursuit, as we have no idea where the Banten is headed. However, the Commandant's death won't go unnoticed. Longway is devastated, but I have a feeling we'll cross paths with both the Banten and the Morning Star again. There's little point in searching for them now - they'll lay low for a while. So, I'll focus on my other business until I hear about them again.
#TEXT   18
If Longway were in my shoes, he'd probably say something like, “Accidents aren't random,” quoting one of his Chinese sages. I never imagined that a routine encounter with shipwrecked sailors would put me back on the trail of the Morning Star. They convinced me to take them to Belize, where I learned of the demise of the notorious pirate, Matthew Lutter. He was defeated by a merchant - a most unusual tale, especially since it involved a peculiar galleon flying the Spanish flag. It must have been Oliveiro Fermentelos. But since he's no longer in port, I'll seek the commandant's permission to speak with Matt before his execution.
#TEXT   18_1
In Belize I learned of the demise of the notorious pirate, Matthew Lutter. He was defeated by a merchant - a most unusual tale, especially since it involved a peculiar galleon flying the Spanish flag. It must have been Oliveiro Fermentelos. But since he's no longer in port, I'll seek the commandant's permission to speak with Matt before his execution.
#TEXT   19
Sometimes the hunter and prey switch roles. Windbag Matt turned out to be quite talkative - maybe too talkative. We managed to get into the prison and speak with him before his execution. I wonder if Lutter was always like this, or if his defeat at the hands of Fermentelos drove him mad. He ranted about how the Morning Star fired first on his Seagull and took away "his treasure," now destined for "Him." Ridiculous. Oliveiro is likely heading to Port Royal or Capsterville to sell those strategic goods he was rewarded with for capturing Matt. We could try to intercept him on the high seas, but Longway is strongly against it. He fears sinking the Star and losing any chance of finding his sister. I'll have plenty of time at sea to figure out the best way to approach this.
#TEXT   20
Forgive me, Longway, but I'm not going to bury my entire crew, my ship, and myself. You may call me a coward, but I believe it was your recklessness that got us here. We could have intercepted the Star on the high seas, but no, you decided the roadstead was a better option. Longway's risky plan failed, and even at night, the galleon's deck was swarming with men. We had to retreat before we were overwhelmed. Back in the wardroom, we agreed that fighting under the fort's guns would be suicide, and I still stand by that. So we left the island's waters. I suggested to Longway that we wait for the Star to move on and try to intercept her again, but he refused. Well, I did what I could...
#TEXT   21
I decided not to make Longway nervous, so I avoided attacking the Morning Star on the open sea. We found her exactly where we expected, anchored in the roadstead. Boarding her directly was out of the question. While I was weighing our options, Longway proposed a plan: we'd anchor our ship in @<sText> and approach the Star in dinghies under the cover of night, keeping things as quiet as possible. He insisted on taking part in the boarding, which is understandable.
#TEXT   22
I'm not sure I would have dared dig deeper if one of my most trusted officers wasn't involved. A new trail leads to Tortuga, where its governor, Levasseur, turns out to be connected to Longway's hated group - Joep van der Vink and Oliveiro Fermentelos. The latter was murdered... by the new captain of the Morning Star. Edgardo Sotta, a young Spaniard, had long coveted that heavy galleon. Van der Vink, determined to avenge Oliveiro for a betrayal long ago, conspired with Sotta and a certain “her” who aided them in the plot. They were all very concerned that Levasseur wouldn't discover their conspiracy. Longway, on the other hand, fears that this mysterious “her” might actually be his sister.
In addition, we found Matt Lutter's "treasure" - Mrs. Annabel Lutter, his widow and a mulatto who had been targeted by Francois, who usually doesn't fancy dark-skinned women. It seems Matt really was working for him. But as soon as Lutter learned of his patron's intentions, he fled Tortuga with his treasure. Unfortunately, they were never destined for a peaceful life - Sotta didn't just attack the Seagull on a whim. It was a hit - Edgardo had received direct orders from Francois to find and deliver Annabel - intact, unharmed, untouched. According to Annabel, Levasseur has an unhealthy appetite for women - in every sense of the word. Various women are brought to him, whom he keeps, tortures, and rapes in his secret lair.
It took everything I had to dissuade Longway from launching a full-scale assault on Levasseur to find out more about his sister, knowing Francois wouldn't willingly tell us anything. I promised Longway that I would revisit this issue as soon as we secured Svenson's support. In the meantime, he asked me to take him to Capsterville so that Georges Gravel could gather more leads while we prepare.
#TEXT   23
If any planter saw me now, they'd probably laugh themselves silly - a gentleman running errands for his yellow-skinned servant! But in all seriousness, Longway didn't dare visit Gravel himself, so he asked me to do it. Remembering his stories, I decided to continue the bluff he'd started and told Georges that Van Merden needed him again. Worked like a charm. Now we just need the necessary support for a heart-to-heart with Levasseur.
#TEXT   24
I've heard that some governors forbid their commandants and other high-ranking officers from taking on cases where their friends or relatives are involved. Whether this is right or wrong, I suppose, will always be debated. In our case, my "high-ranking officer," Longway, was trying to save his sister, and I, as his "lord" captain, failed to protect him. When we engaged Fermentelos's men on his galleon, they were already well-prepared, despite the cover of night, and we were heavily outnumbered. No matter how skilled Longway was, a pack of hyenas can always take down a lion, and that's what happened to my navigator. Without him, I have no reason to risk the lives of the rest of my men. After more than a decade, his unfortunate sister is likely long gone from this world anyway... What a sad ending.
#TEXT   25
I always knew. Sooner or later we'd have to face him, but I thought it would be on my terms. Now, though, everything's changed. I can't wait any longer and I must make a move with whatever resources we have right now, because my beloved's safety is at stake. As far as I know, there's only one rich and powerful Huguenot in the Archipelago who can afford mercenaries - Francois Levasseur. His men tried to kidnap my woman, but we managed to fight them off together. Longway will probably be overjoyed that we're finally getting back on the case. I just hope Georges Gravel has found something useful for us in the meantime.
#TEXT   26
Здесь ничего нет :(
#TEXT   27
Tortuga's shores are just around the corner. I can't linger in Levasseur's domain for too long - after that attack, anything could happen. I need to get information about Longway's sister as soon as possible and get back to the open sea, where I'll feel safer with my beloved on board.
#TEXT   28
Usually, I always learn things from the innkeeper or the drunks. But apparently, Levasseur had a respectful conversation with the tavernkeeper once, explaining what he could and couldn't say to strangers. But the first passerby told me that, though he didn't know Joep personally, he had seen him from time to time in town with his friend Rober Martene. Martene had recently returned to the island and was urgently repairing his ship, the galleon Voltigeur, after a fierce storm.
#TEXT   29
This is it! The long-awaited denouement seems to be approaching. The passerby didn't deceive me, and Rober Martene was indeed strolling in the bay by the lighthouse while his galleon was being repaired. Not the friendliest man in the world, but somehow I don't care, since what he shared with me solves everything. Turns out there's another brothel on Tortuga, in that building with the columns. It's a particularly expensive establishment that only accepts payment in doubloons, so not many people know about it. What's more important is that the owner is a yellow-skinned woman. Of course, it could be some other Asian woman who somehow ended up here. But we have to make sure. Except... how do I explain this to @<sText>...
#TEXT   30
All I managed to find out is that the brothel's owner is indeed Asian, her name is Belle Etoile, and she intends to move to Port-au-Prince, as things aren't going well under Levasseur's rule. She needs money to set up a business on Espanola, and this mystery lady plans to get it from Marcus Tyrex as a loan. I should head to La Vega immediately - we might catch her there.
#TEXT   31
I didn't inform my famme fatale of my plans to visit the brothel, which turned out to be a mistake - she learned about it from the crew anyway. I managed to smooth things over, but I should be more careful from now on.
#TEXT   32
Well, it was still worth checking. Anyway, Belle Etoile hasn't seen Tyrex yet-either she hasn't gotten around to it, or she changed her mind. Marcus mentioned that he hasn't visited the brothel himself; it's not easy for a Brotherhood baron to enter Levasseur's territory. Although he envies the fact that I've already been there, he'd love to visit it as well and help the mistress financially. Well, now it's off to Port-au-Prince. But how do I approach de Mussac discreetly?
#TEXT   33
I got back on board just in time to be attacked as soon as I got to the bunks. I've seen this ship before - most recently, off the coast of Tortuga. So they've been following us all this time? Let's try to find out who sent them. Could it be Levasseur?
#TEXT   34
It turned out to be not just a familiar ship, but familiar faces as well! The captain of this frigate was the same peasant who shoved me when I was leaving the brothel a couple of days ago. I had forgotten the incident myself, but he certainly reminded me. Unfortunately, the man refused to tell me who he worked for. No big deal. I'm at a point where I can fend off anything they throw at me. @<sText> Off to Port-au-Prince now.
#TEXT   35
Well, we successfully fought off those mysterious attackers. We had to send them to the bottom-they were determined to engage us in a gunnery duel, avoiding boarding at all costs. Unusual. Perhaps their orders were to capture me alive, so they avoided unnecessary boarding to minimize their losses. Didn't help them in the end.
#TEXT   36
It's good to have a place to wait out the storm - both literally and figuratively. I don't believe I'm saying this myself, but at last, we, along with my better half, set foot on solid ground after this storm, tired and exhausted, where we were met by Henri Thibaut, de Mussac's messenger and a well-bred young man. He took us to a house that the governor had specially prepared for us as soon as he saw our vessel so that we might rest. His Lordship, however, would like to see me as soon as possible and out of earshot. Does he know I'm looking for Chang Xin?
#TEXT   37
That vile snake Henri Thibaut, a scoundrel just like his uncle, deceived me! De Mussac didn't know of any house, nor of the presence of Levasseur's nephew in town! They took *id девушки* with them and boarded that galleon of Rober Martene's! And Chang Xin was with them! Luckily, Longway arrived in town just in time, and we rushed in pursuit on his ship. Henri, you bastard, you abducted the love of my life. Just wait-I swear, if they've harmed *id девушки* in that house or on board the Voltigeur, I'll raze Tortuga to the ground and leave no stone unturned!
#TEXT   38
Dammit! Oh God, help me. Send me wind in my sails, do anything, just help me make it in time... Rober Martene couldn't stand the torture when Alonso took up the roaster. It was probably a mistake to call him, but I had no better choice anyway. I saw a lugger not far from the Voltigeur, probably that bastard Thibaut's vessel. Her sails had already disappeared over the horizon, carrying my love away. We'll have to face Levasseur in his lair. I won't have time to search the whole island. I'll anchor in Fisheye Beach. Direct siege of the fort is not an option. That bastard will kill her in a heartbeat if I run in guns blazing. We'll have to proceed with caution. Just hang on, please...
#TEXT   39
I owe Longway my life. I never thought a good Christian, which I want to believe I still am, would enjoy what he did to that dog Martene - but I'm not ashamed to admit it. It was worth it - if only because Rober told me everything. My love is on Thibault's lugger. There's no way I can catch her, so I'll have to find my love on Tortuga, in Levasseur's secret lair, underground beneath the city. The entrance is hidden in a huge barrel in one of the dead ends. Clever, I'll give him that. But it won't help him or that fucker Henri or anyone who steps in my way down there. I got five days to do it. Then... then it'll be too late. I've never prayed so hard for a tailwind in my life, and I hope the Lord will send it into my sails.
#TEXT   40
Vensan is hardly recognizable now. It seems the shift from the deck of a ship to an office on the island has worn him out terribly over time, leaving him both frustrated and exhausted. Be that as it may, no one has seen Belle Étoile in La Vega - it's likely she headed straight for Port-au-Prince.
#TEXT   41
If I had any other reliable option, I'd use it. But I don't. Saving @<sText> at all costs, not wasting time on Longway's happy family reunion - he can handle it himself. If anyone else knows where Levasseur tortures his victims, it's probably his wife. I hope she's still in her chambers where I spoke to her last time. And that she doesn't raise a citywide alarm or run away...
#TEXT   42
Though I worry for @<sText> with all my heart and soul, I know that splitting up now would doom us all. What if Levasseur's lair is perfectly guarded? What if Longway makes a mess of things and massacres the streets of the city as he did on Guadalupe? I made the hard but seemingly correct decision to run quickly with Longway to his sister's house first, so we can rush to @<sText>'s rescue together. I hope I can make it in time. God, give me time and good luck.

Well, Marceline was very surprised to see me again after all this time. She thought I'd come to get even with her for screwing me over the last time. I don't think we would have agreed if I'd told her I didn't care about that, and I didn't really care about what happened, even if it wasn't very pleasant. So I had to play dumb to lower her guard. But it was still a tough conversation - she knew how my meeting with Levasseur would end, and she didn't want to risk it - who knows what her fate might be in the future. But, as much of a bitch as she was, she told me where to go - there's a large barrel in one of the dead ends of the city dungeon, where the passage to François's hideout begins. Hold on a bit longer, @<sText> - I'm coming...
#TEXT   44
Marceline told me everything. Of course she always knew. Her husband's fate is of little concern to her - unlike her own. I don't think she'll stay in Tortuga much longer if I succeed. But I don't care about her misfortunes - after all, everyone is the blacksmith of their own happiness. To forge and save mine, I must hurry. The passage to Levasseur's lair is hidden next to a huge barrel in one of the dead ends of Tortuga's dungeon.
#TEXT   45
She's dead. I didn't make it in time. This world feels smaller now, like I've lost half of it. Now it's time to find Chang Xin and figure out what really happened. She was involved in Levasseur's bloody scheme, and I'll have to decide what to do with her. And God help Longway if he tries to stop me.
#TEXT   46
Why save someone who isn't in immediate danger or perhaps even need saving? When we arrived at Tortuga, Longway insisted we go after his sister first. I convinced him to help me save @<sText> instead. Now, the main thing is to find the secret passage to the dungeon that Marten told us about. Very quickly.
#TEXT   47
Even though I'm the captain and Longway is my subordinate, he is not my slave and I am not some plantation owner. We came to Tortuga together, but for different reasons. So, we decided to split up again: Longway went to his sister, and I'm rushing to rescue @<sText>. Hopefully, I can find the secret passage to Levasseur's lair quickly enough.
#TEXT   48
The former governor of Tortuga, removed from office by my own hand, is in my hold. I'm sure the Chevalier de Poincy will be delighted with this gift. But at what cost... @<sText>
#TEXT   49
I didn't think I would take such pleasure in watching a man tremble with fear, anticipating the terrible fate that awaits him. Perhaps it's not fitting for a French nobleman. But this man was Levasseur, who, through my efforts, has lost control of both his island and his destiny. Given what he's done to my beloved, it's the least I can do to see justice served. And to think, she should be in bed recovering from her ordeal, but instead, she's decided to come with me to face Chang Xin. Well, she has the right to see the end of this story with her own eyes.
#TEXT   50
@<sText> is safe on the ship. Her battered face is etched in my mind. As Longway and I head out to meet Chang Xin, my hands are trembling with anger. But I will listen to my officer's sister. There has to be an explanation for everything in this world - including her involvement in Levasseur's plan.
#TEXT   51
I sent @<sText>  to the ship. She's safe there, which brings me a sense of relief I have never felt before. I won't put a bullet in Chang Xin's head the moment I step through the door - I want to hear what drove her to do it first. Then I'll decide her fate. And if Longway tries to stop me, I'll deal with him too.
#TEXT   52
Sometimes those we haven't seen in decades turn from bright human beings into monsters. Longway experienced that today. We found his sister, and there was no trace of the girl he once knew. When her star extinguished, her humanity did too. Longway couldn't accept it, and instead of a reunion, there was a bloody family quarrel. Now, we have another showdown with Levasseur. The passage to his lair starts next to a huge barrel hidden in one of Tortuga's dungeon dead ends. God, let @<sText> be alright...
#TEXT   53
Some say you can't choose family. And some say family doesn't start with blood. Longway searched for Chang Xin for years, only to find that she had become a horrible person, never lifting a finger to meet him halfway. It affected him so much that he decided to give up on her and stop her, to finally end the nightmares on Tortuga. Now he's convinced his real family is us. As for mine, I need to report to the Governor-General so he can keep his word and reunite me with my brother. I hope it doesn't end the same way it did for Longway.
#TEXT   54
Why is this so hard? Did I really think Longway was my friend, not just an officer? Did I hope this mess could be resolved without bloodshed? Or am I upset because Longway and Mary made the final call, not me? Whatever the case, it's done. Maybe there was always something rotten in Longway. We talked to his sister, a monster almost as terrible as Levasseur, and then Longway tried to get rid of us for his ‘real' family. I wanted to leave without spilling blood, but Mary... being Mary, couldn't let it slide. Now, the two rotten apples are feeding the worms together, just like Longway always wanted. As for Mary and me, the nightmare is over. Hopefully, soon the Chevalier will release my brother, and a new, brighter chapter of our lives will begin.
#TEXT   55
It turns out I'm a bad captain-at least that's what Longway said when we found his sister. We had a heart-to-heart, blaming each other for everything. After all I'd done for him! Things got heated, and we were close to coming to blows when Helen intervened and cooled our tempers. I used to laugh at stories of last-minute forgiveness, but when she suggested we just leave and ignore the reunited family, I felt strangely relieved. I think I'll forget about Longway and his sister soon enough. I don't wish them harm-maybe he'll reignite his extinguished star. But I'm certain that mine and Helen's shines brighter now. Time to leave this dungeon they call Tortuga and report back to Poincy.
#TEXT   56
I need a new navigator and vanguard. Longway has finally reunited with his family, such as it is. After a long talk with Chang Xin, he decided to give up the name Longway and return to his birth name, Chang Tu. He left my crew to stay with his sister and guide her onto a better path. Who am I to stop this reunion after all these years? His sister wanted him to get rid of me or for us to kill each other, but that didn't happen. Longway kept his integrity and humanity. Maybe he can rekindle her extinguished star. As for me, it's time to report back to Poincy.

Bad time, bad place. Longway and I finally found his sister, ending his years of searching and bloodshed. But as soon as his search ended, he decided his service to me was over too. I didn't mind letting him go, but I needed help with Levasseur. Longway refused, saying I could handle it myself. Maybe he meant to cheer me up, but I felt betrayed. Something snapped in me, and I lashed out. Now, @<sText>-I hope I don't lose her today too. Before she died, Chang Xin told me the passage to Levasseur's lair starts near a large barrel hidden in one of Tortuga's dungeon dead ends.

Boldness is a second kind of luck, as they say. And often enough, it works. But not today. It was a damn inappropriate time when Longway barged into my tavern room right after a heated battle with Levasseur's mercenaries, who wanted... @<sText>. Longway had received a letter from Gravel and learned the current route of Joep van der Vink. For this, he needed a ship and a crew of mercenaries ready to catch the scoundrel while I gather information on Tortuga. And what did Longway demand? A mere... two and a half thousand. Doubloons!!! Doubloons, for God's sake. When you could buy and fully outfit a fine brig for around fifty thousand pesos. That's exactly what I gave him, though he was terribly displeased. Am I a bad person? No. I have more important matters to attend to - course set for Tortuga.
#TEXT 	59
Pesos really do grow on trees, but doubloons - no. Or it's just my luck here, always having to hand over these fortunes rather than keeping them. I thought I'd never see anything like when I handed over a million pesos to the Chevalier again. Yet here I am, having to part with an obscene amount of money once more, though it's smaller this time - only about a quarter of a million. But who demanded it!.. My first officer, Longway. After learning from Georges' letter where Joep van der Vink might be, he was burning to split our forces and personally track him down. And he needed money for a fully equipped crew of fighting men ready to sail immediately and do whatever's required without asking questions. Back home, you could live comfortably on that money, but Longway and his family have suffered too much over the years. Let him enjoy his revenge. After all, you can't take all that gold and silver to the grave. I also need to weigh anchor and set course for Tortuga as soon as possible - Levasseur's men attacked us, @<sText> and I, right in the tavern room, so time is running out, and none of us are safe any longer.

The "Meifeng". I should have guessed that Longway wouldn't be able to let her go. When someone in town handed him a letter from Georges Gravel, stating places where Joep van der Vink most frequently visited, Longway asked me for a ship and a mountain of gold for a crew of mercenaries ready to sail immediately without questions. This, of course, is madness, but Longway is my loyal friend and comrade, and I can't turn my back on him at a time like this... can I?
If "Mei" doesn't work out, perhaps Longway can be appeased with another unique ship. At worst, I can capture or buy any light warship: a war schooner, brig, corvette, polacre, xebec, or brigantine.
Longway, for now, is heading to meet with the mercenaries. And this is after Levasseur's men attacked us, @<sText> and me, right in the tavern room. What a mad start to the day...

Black Mark

Today I witnessed an unusual scene and met an unusual man. As I passed the lighthouse of Barbados, I saw smugglers waiting for a client. They spotted me too and told me to get out so I wouldn't scare off their buyer. Ironically, their threat was also a warning - if I had left immediately, I might have missed all the fun. Just as we started speaking, we were raided by a patrol and a townsman looking for someone among us. The person they were looking for was Tommy Irons, a marksman who had his memory blown out during the English Revolution. Irons had slept with that civilian's wife, so the cuck had assembled a squad of soldiers to chase him. I was impressed with the way Tommy blew the man's head off with one good shot from the lighthouse, so I hired him when he offered me his services. He made some pretty impressive demands, too. His constant boasting and jokes are beginning to get on my nerves, but it's the talent that counts, isn't it?

Five hundred gold pieces. With that money you could buy - well, a lot. It's robbery! At the lighthouse of Barbados, I met Tommy Irons, a mercenary and talented marksman who knows his value well. Too well, in fact. We agreed that he would join me for a purse of gold. He'll wait for me in a local cave for a couple of days.
#TEXT   3
I didn't manage to collect that much money in just a couple of days. Had he asked for pesos - fine - they do indeed grow on trees here. But no, monsieur best shot in the world wanted only doubloons. No wonder that he's still traveling alone with such an attitude and demands. No regrets.
#TEXT   4
I brought Tommy the gold he wanted, and if he's half as good as he boasts, it was a worthwhile investment. I just hope he doesn't get me into any trouble...
#TEXT   5
I've certainly seen all sorts of quirks, however Tommy Irons stands out quite a bit, even in this crazy world. He asked me for a paper cartridge once outside of town. Just one. When I told him I didn't have anything like that in my pockets, and offered to get more from the ship, Tommy left my crew. He made a scene too. I guess he got his head banged up too hard back in England. I hope I never have people like him in my life again - abandoning me if I can't immediately fulfill their whims.
#TEXT   6
Am I a real captain, or do I lack the guts? That's something Tommy was trying to figure that out really hard before he left my ship. He told me more about his past - his real past, not the story he told when we first met. He'd gone with the pirates and praised Jack, his previous captain, without holding a grudge against him for refusing to help with his revenge. But when I wouldn't have done the same, he called me weak. People often contradict themselves, and I shouldn't be surprised. I'm not turning England against me because of this lunatic. Nor do I regret his departure.
#TEXT   7
Tommy started to trust me, so he told me his life story while we walked through the jungle. It turns out he'd known Francis for a long time - the civilian he shot from the lighthouse. They were war comrades until Reasley and another man fled the battlefield, after which they slandered Tommy. They had Irons exiled to the quarries of Barbados. As soon as Tommy learned his old enemies were in the Archipelago, he became consumed with revenge. But Jack, his former pirate captain, wouldn't help, so Tommy left his crew and took up the cause himself. The second traitor, Gabriel Callow, continued his military career despite everything. A coward then and now - he usually sails around Jamaica on his ship, the Principio, avoiding warships larger than his own and even merchant ships bigger than a barque. Tommy may not have told me the whole truth from the start, but I'm determined to help him get his revenge. We'll get a barque, fly a false flag, and lure Gabe into a fight.

Sometimes I forget what a useful skill it is to play dumb at the right moment - I've rarely used it myself. Tommy Irons, on the other hand, wasn't as simple as I thought. He asked for my help and told me what really happened to him, both here and in England. There had been no resignation - Irons had been framed by two fellow soldiers, who got him sentenced to hard labor in the quarries of Barbados. Seeing the enemy's superior forces, they fled, then claimed Tommy conspired with the King's supporters. But fate was more favorable than first thought, and the ship carrying Irons was attacked by pirates, who saved him. That's how Tommy ended up with them. One day he heard the two men who caused his downfall were here too. The pirates refused to help, so he left their ship to seek his own justice. One of those men was Frank Reasley, the lighthouse cuck I met previously. The other, Gabriel Callow, remained in the military, rose to lieutenant, and even became a ship's captain. Gabe settled in Port Royal, but Tommy doesn't know exactly where. I've decided to help him get his justice. Off we go to Portland Cove, Jamaica.

It's not as simple as it seemed at first glance. That's what I initially thought when Tommy told me his story and asked for my help. And now, after talking to a local drunk about Gabe, my suspicions have only been strengthened. Everyone in town thinks the best of Callow. Even Colonel Doyley himself speaks highly of him. Gabe has a reputation for honesty and combat bravery, which doesn't fit Irons' story. Gabe lives in the house next to the shop but only goes there to sleep - he's only home from ten in the evening until six in the morning. Perhaps it makes sense to have a word with him first instead of just leaving a message and vanishing in the dark...
#TEXT   10
Rotten people often convince others they're not. Even those who seem like excellent judges of character - Gabe managed to win the confidence of Colonel Doyley himself, who values him greatly. I also learned in the tavern that he's reputed to be honest and brave. How ironic. Our brave man's house is next to the shop, but he's rarely there - only in the evenings, when all the town's main establishments are closed. It's even better - I can slip in there and leave a message at any time.

I've seen a lot of old married couples bickering. It's funny sometimes. And what I saw today was very reminiscent of that. Gabe took the bait, and we successfully boarded him. In the cabin, Tommy joined me to exchange a few pleasantries with Callow. They each voiced their truth, their version of what had happened in England, and colorfully accused each other of everything they could and couldn't. After that, Tommy and I finished what we'd started. He was glad that I'd helped him get revenge on Gabe, so he finally let go of the resentment that had been eating away at him and closed an old, not-so-pleasant chapter in his life. After which he threw back two jokes at once in his best tradition. The first was that I was no longer his captain but a true friend. And two, he handed me... a black spot. But not just any black spot. The one that was meant for Gabe. Tommy's convinced that when he embroidered Jolly Roger on his old silk scarf, that piece of cloth immediately brought him luck. Hopefully now it will bring it to me too.
#TEXT   12
Where is it seen that a merchant ship sinks a warship? However, that's exactly what happened. Who knows what Gabe was after with his ship - maybe he wanted to tire us out with a long fight first, break a few masts, and mow down the crew before boarding. Or maybe he realized we weren't merchants and was going to send us to the bottom instead of running away. But another of our salvos hit below the waterline, and so this old pink, already seemingly barely afloat, finally went down. Tommy laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of the situation, but as he calmed down, he noted that he wanted to deal with Gabe face-to-face, even if he was generally glad it was over. So happy that he even called me a friend. And he gave me a black mark. But not in that way, of course. Tommy is convinced that when he embroidered the Jolly Roger on his old silk handkerchief, that piece of cloth immediately began to bring him good luck. Hopefully, now it will bring it to me. Time to leave Jamaican waters and change ships - you can't make much money on a barque.

Done. Since Gabe is away from home most of the time, not getting caught was easy. Now, all that's left is to return to Tommy. Let's hope Callow takes a good look at his desks and trunks when he gets home and doesn't go straight to bed, or we'll be waiting for a while.
#TEXT 	14
Today, I witnessed the ever-sarcastic Tommy smiling and laughing with genuine happiness. Gabe, as we'd expected, didn't think he'd show up to the duel alone - the soldiers came with him. I'm surprised he took so few of them with him, and Colonel Doyley's favorite wasn't given more. But together, we dealt with them all. At this point, Tommy's long-awaited revenge finally came to a successful end, and he thanked me for having been and being an excellent captain to him, even better than Jack, whom he had previously held up as an example in almost everything. He also said that I was his first real friend in a long time. He said it in a rough way, of course, but I suppose his dignity and pride wouldn't have allowed him to say it without jokes and barbs. But it didn't matter, after all, he was a simple English laborer and soldier. And now a loyal comrade.
#TEXT 	15
When I entered Gabe's house, I immediately ran into him - either he's a very light sleeper, or he didn't sleep at all. He doesn't strike me as a sneaky coward, unlike what Tommy told me. During our conversation, Gabe claimed that Irons wasn't who he said he was, that he was the one who betrayed their company. I don't know who's telling the truth. But I'm not going to stoop to their level, change sides, and break my word. I started this with Tommy, and I'll finish it with him. Gabe took the message and the black spot from my hands. Back to the cove then.
#TEXT 	16
There was always something about Tommy that didn't sit right with me. And I was right to talk to Callow. Gabe is indeed an officer with great poise, bravery, and discipline - everything people say about him is true. Colonel Doyley is a good judge of character afterall. On that ill-fated day in England, Thomas was the one who fled the battlefield, after promising the Ironsides he'd bring reinforcements. They waited, fending off an attack by the King's cavalry, and almost all of them died. How Tommy got his injury remains an open question. If he ever did. I've decided to take Gabriel up on his offer and put Thomas on trial again. But I don't think he'll surrender. So Callow's off for reinforcements, and I'm heading back to the cove, where we'll all meet.
#TEXT 	17
I've had enough of people trying to use me. Tommy had learned to be a great judge of character from his years in the army and with pirates, so he guessed my lateness was because I was talking to Gabe. The latter showed up right after I killed a pissed-off Irons, and not a second before. Callow said he was just rounding up the best people to arrest Tom. And then it became clear to me that Gabe was just watching and waiting for us to kill each other, so I told him what I thought of him. Apparently, Tommy had been right all along, because Callow, instead of trying to reassure the man who'd rid him of an old enemy, said he wasn't going to listen to my speculations, and then came at me with his ‘best men.' Apparently, that was supposed to be the end of this story that started back in England - the death of everyone involved - Tommy, Frank, and now Gabe as well.

Are there many people in the world willing to fight to the death over their grandmother's crockery that they'll never use themselves? Or for the sake of another unnecessary thing, but given by some great man? In this case, instead of conventional crockery, it's a rapier given to Gabe by Colonel Doyley. Wonderful in its own right, but the trouble is, Callow prefers broadswords, so it was just hanging on a nail. He lent it to me to fight Tommy, and then demanded it back in such a disgusting manner.... Our conversation went nowhere, and after Irons, I had to deal with Gabe. Hopefully, I won't face any more of this kind of madness for today, or any time soon.
#TEXT 	19
Which of those two ended up telling the truth? I guess I'll never find out. We had a fight, and I had to deal with him here and now, on my own. Callow showed up just as I was finishing Irons. Gabe's excuses were, frankly, weak, and I realized I was just being used. Tommy may not have been a saint, but killing Callow as well would have meant that the first one's death would have been pointless. Maybe Gabe deserved to die, though. The handkerchief that Irons turned into a black spot and the grin of a skull and bones embroidered on it will forever remind me of that day.
