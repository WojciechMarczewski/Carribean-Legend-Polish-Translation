Tartane
{
A longboat isn't the preferred vessel for a captain accustomed to the high life. However, if fate has taken his favorite ship this humble boat will suffice for quick travel between islands. Just keep telling yourself that it's only a temporary measure!
}

WarTartane
{
Initially tartanes like this were used for fishing and trading. They were equipped with light cannons to patrol coastal waters and chase off small-time pirates and Indian raids.
}

Barque
{
A barque is ideally suited for long merchant voyages. Having a spacious hold and formidable firepower, the barque is considered one of the best vessels in its class. However, its hull shape doesn't allow it to accelerate or maneuver quickly, causing it to lag behind lighter ships when it comes to sailing performance.
}

Schooner
{
Solid all-around performance together with low displacement and a spacious hold make the schooner one of the most attractive ships for merchants who cannot afford a fluyt.
}

Barkentine
{
The emergence of barkentine was caused by the need to make trading vessels easier to handle for smaller and inexperienced crews. This involved replacing square sails on the mainmast of a barque with triangular ones and using more block-and-tackle rigging. With a combination of square and latten sails, the barkentine sails confidently on any course.
}

Shnyava
{
A snow is the predecessor of the brig. Having comparable speed and sturdiness to a military brig, snows are highly valued by wealthy merchants and smugglers. These vessels are so popular that you're very likely to see them in any lively port in Northern Europe or the Caribbean.
}

Fleut
{
An extremly successful Dutch design originally designed to cheat Danish tolls, the fluyt (pronounced 'flute') is one of the best choices as a trading ship. When it comes to hold space and hull integrity, it is unrivaled in its class. However, it cannot carry many cannons as most of the ship space is devoted to cargo. Therefore, its usage for military purpose is limited to self-defense. 
}

Caravel
{
The distinctive rigging of a caravel makes it easily recognizable even afar. Its outdated design and mediocre sailing performance however does not allow caravels to compete with modern vessels, despite a large number of cannons.
}

Pinnace
{
Like fluyts, pinnaces are widely used as a merchant vessel. It is large and sturdy, good for long journeys. The hold's capacity allows for the transportation of a large amount of cargo. Due to sharp contours of the bow a pinnace can develop decent speed even with heavy load.
}

Caracca
{
An obsolete design along with the caravel, the carrack's heavy tower-like superstructures on the forecastle and stern significantly worsen its sailing capabilities. A sturdy hull and a capacious hold are the only advantages of this old vessel.
}

Navio
{
The navio is a Spanish-designed heavy galleon that only wealthy merchants can afford. A large and sturdy hull, capacious hold, and good rigging allow the navio to make the long voyages from Panama to the Phillipines and about three dozen cannons provide decent protection against any pirates and privateers who covet its cargo.
}

EastIndiaMan
{
East Indiamen are transoceanic merchant ships that embody the best properties of fluyts and pinnaces. They are mostly used for long voyages in guarded convoys, but some of them are so large and well-armed that they can sail alone. Trying to take down an East Indianman has led to many pirates becoming either very rich or very dead.
}

LuggerQuest
{
A courier lugger was designed specifically for speedy mail delivery. Excellent sailing performance, a sturdy hull, and decent armament allow for the safe transport of urgent dispatches and small packages of important cargo.
}

Lugger
{
A lugger is a small fast single decked ship, highly valued by merchants and smugglers for its speed and maneuverability. Despite its small size, a lugger has good seaworthiness and can perform long blue water voyages.
}

Sloop
{
A sloop has good speed and maneuverability and carries decent armament for its size. It is a highly effective patrolling vessel, and is often used for scouting ahead of frigates and ships of the line in shallow waters where brigs cannot go. A sloop is often a young navy lieutenant's first independent command.
}

Brigantine
{
A sailing craft with near-legendary sailing characteristics. Fast and maneuverable, the brigantine flies across the water like a swallow. It is especially valued by pirates, privateers, and adventurers of all sorts.
}

Brig
{
The brig is widely used by European navies for scouting and pirate hunting. Its high speed and maneuverability make it one of the most well-rounded vessels, although, being square-rigged, it is somewhat limited when sailing into the wind.
}

Schooner_W
{
The American colonists of New England were the first to appreciate the humble schooners and to begin using them for military purposes. A well-armed, fast, and agile war schooner is a serious threat for any trading vessel.
}

Galeon_l
{
Emerging in the early 16th century, the Spanish-built galleon was initially modeled on the design of the carrack, intended as a military vessel from its inception. By the mid-17th century, the galleon had reached the pinnacle of its evolution before yielding to modern ships. Despite this, it hasn't yet fallen into obsolescence, remaining in faithful service to sailors of all nations.
}

Corvette
{
Corvettes are built for independent operations in littoral waters as well as scouting and important courier service. Possessing good speed and maneuverability, a corvette can catch up with lighter ships and successfully avoid combat with heavier ones. After commanding a sloop, the most common next step in a navy career is taking command of a corvette.
}

XebekVML
{
A xebec was designed and built for fighting in the contrary winds of the Mediterranean. Thanks to the narrow hull and large lateen sails, a xebec develops great speed into the wind, but demonstrates worse performance sailing with the wind. Valued for their speed and maneuverability, xebecs are highly favored by the fearsome Barbary Corsairs and their archrivals the Knights of Malta alike.
}

Polacre
{
A polacre is a close relative to the xebec. Unlike the xebec, a poleacre carries square sails on the mainmast, which allows it to sail more confidently with the wind. This however comes at the expense of its maneuverability, worsens the sailing capabilities into the wind, and significantly raises the demands on the crew.
}

Galeon_h
{
A heavy galleon is a strong military ship, intended for escorting treasure convoys and transporting valuable cargo on its own. It has mediocre sailing capabilities but its large cannons, sturdy hull and large crew provide great protection.
}

Elcasador
{
A formidable warship crafted specifically for special operations across the open seas, this galleon stands as a testament to maritime prowess. Commissioned by the Casa de Contratacion, its primary mission is to eradicate the most notorious pirates that jeopardize trade routes within the region and the vested interests of the Spanish Crown.
}

Frigate
{
Frigates are independent deep water cruisers that are larger than corvettes but smaller than ships of the line. Frigates have good sailing capabilities and heavy firepower, are intended for long-range scouting, trade interdiction, escorting transports, and screening line ships in combat. Many navy officers achieved great fame when commanding their first frigate.
}

Frigate_h
{
Heavy frigates are designed specifically for guarding large convoys and independant operations. While being slightly inferior to 4th class ships of the line in terms of firepower and hull integrity, they outperform them in terms of sailing capabilities, which makes them a terrifying weapon when commanded by an experienced captain.
}

LineShip
{
The smallest type that can be designated by the English Navy as a 'ship of the line.' Lacks the firepower to match their larger counterparts, making them unsuitable for leading the line of battle. However, their their speed and maneuverability allows to screen the fleet, chase down damaged ships, or harass enemy trade lanes while in detached operations.
}

Warship
{
Ships of this type were built back nearly thirty years ago in the times of Cardinal Richelieu. Now they are rather outdated in terms of construction. Despite this, they retain excellent sailing abilities and the capacity to carry the heaviest cannons, making them a significant threat.
}

Ecliaton
{
Ships of this type were built back nearly thirty years ago in the times of Cardinal Richelieu. Now they are rather outdated in terms of construction. Despite this, they retain excellent sailing abilities and the capacity to carry the heaviest cannons, making them a significant threat.
}

Pink
{
The Pink is a small ship designed for light goods transport and light escort. Though it has weak guns and runs with a small crew, this ship has optimal balance between trade and battle suitability, and many captains prize the Pink for its maneuverability and sailing characteristics. The small size of the Pink makes it a poor choice for traversing long distances across open water.
}

Battleship
{
A versatile warship able to fight in the line of battle, at the head of a flotilla, or independantly. Their firepower is substantial enough to rival even a 100-gun leviathan, while also excelling in maneuverability and speed compared to the latter.
}

Manowar
{
The backbone of every national navy. Combined with frigates and corvettes, they make a fleet both powerful and flexible. Often serve as  flagships.
}

Manowar_e
{
The first-rate class ship of the line is a majestic floating fortress, commanding the seas with its awe-inspiring firepower, capable of vanquishing almost any adversary with a few thundering broadsides. These grand vessels, rare treasures among the great naval powers, carry position of flagships in great battles, symbolizing strength and supremacy in the waters.
}

MayFang
{
This xebec has a lighter hull built to the detriment of its strength, but she is an unsurpassed sailor - only a few ships in the Caribbean can match her speed.
And if you get caught, twenty medium cannons are a serious help in any naval confrontation.
}

Mirage
{
Unlike bomb ketches, privateer ketches lack the massive mortars meant for the bombardment of land fortresses. These nimble English-designed craft boast streamlined hulls that significantly enhance their sailing capabilities. The speed of privateer ketches is so impressive that even princely yachts might envy their swiftness.
}

Himera
{
A ship specially designed for the needs of British Naval intelligence. Her characteristics are comparable to those of 3rd-rate warships, while retaining the ease of handling of 4th-rate smaller vessels.
}

Valciria
{
An excellent English brig. Exceptional speed, maneuverability, and excellent performance into the wind. With a complement of twenty cannons on deck, this vessel is the coveted dream of many sailors.
}

CORVETTE_QUEST
{
A masterpiece crafted by French shipwrights, this frigate owes its exceptional speed to trapezoid bends that enhance stability and enable a larger sail area. As a result, only a few ships can match its speed, especially when running before the wind.
}

Polacre_q
{
A successful mix of a xebec and a frigate, this polacre showcases an unconventional hull-characterized by a low sea gauge yet high seaboard. Crafted by an ingenious shipbuilder. With three masts, a bowsprit, and numerous sails, she embodies speed and agility. Additionally she is armed with immensely powerful guns. This versatile and unique ship can play any role in the high seas: military, pirate, or trade.
}

ArabellaShip
{
Thanks to previous breakthroughs in the ship design, the speed of this frigate is slightly higher compared to those built several years before. Additionally, it features a sturdier yet lighter hull, representing further advancements in its construction.
}

Flyingdutchman
{
The Caleuche. The nightmare of all sailors...
}

Flyingdutchman_l
{
A Copy of the "Caleuche". 
}

Santisima
{
This ship came off the stocks of the famous Spanish shipyard in Havana. Its hull is slightly lighter and weaker compared to other 1st class ships, but has been compensated for with improved sailing capabilities.
}

NoneBoat
{
No ship. Our hero is currently a scurvy landlubber and may not call himself captain until he acquires a ship.
}

Crew_Exp {Crew experience}

Crew_Exp_hint
{
Crew experience has three categories: naval - affects ship's management; gunnery - affects reloading speed and firing accuracy; and boarding - affects the effectiveness of the crew during boardings.
An experienced crew can have fewer sailors and still be more effective than a large crew of lubbers.
The experience in all three categories is acquired when the crew performs the corresponding action (maneuvering, shooting, boarding). The experience decays if a particular skill hasn't been practiced for an extended period of time.
}

TakeAllGoods_hint
{
The button "reload all goods" reloads the goods to the player's ship based on their average specific value. It starts by reloading the most valuable goods and continues with less valuable ones until the hold reaches full capacity.
}

GoodsKeys_hint
{
The arrow keys "Left" and "Right" will move goods in the selected line by one unit at a time. Using the arrow keys while holding down the Shift key will move the entire cargo.
Right-clicking on the arrows within the merchandise line will shift ten units of that specific merchandise at once.
}

Shipyard_hint
{
You can buy, repair and sell ships at the shipyard.
You may not sell your ship if you have companions on board. Neither can you purchase a ship for you companions if you don't own a ship yourself.
To change the ship or the companion while preserving the crew and the contents of the hold. Select in the squadron list (the left part of the interface) the ship to be substituted, and in the shipyard list (ships offered for sale at the shipyard in the right part of the interface) the desired ship, and then press the "Buy" button.
