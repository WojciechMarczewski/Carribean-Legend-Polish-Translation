OptKurs {Point of Sail}
OptKurs_descr
{
Black arrows on the mini-map show the course at which your ship will move at maximum speed.
~
Some types of ships are capable of sailing almost against the wind, which is useful when you need to catch up with a merchant or escape from a warship.
~
The wind constantly changes its strength and direction. Try to adapt and adjust your course, finding a compromise between the optimal course angle and the direction to your target.

SeaFastTravelEnglish {Fast Travel}
SeaFastTravelEnglish_descr
{
The action menu opens up many useful functions both on land and at sea.
~
The 'Sail To' function allows you to fast travel instantly next to a friendly ship or geographical point. The fast travel distance can be increased by using rarer and more expensive spyglasses.
~
Use the action menu to instantly reach the "Ghost" and then send a longboat to her.

Sometimes it makes sense to slow down time - especially during tough fights. Caribbean Legend is a hard game to master, so use everything you can to gain an edge.

GuideFight {Land Combat}
GuideFight_descr
{
It will take time to master the land combat in the game. If you have control hints enabled, you will see the hotkeys in the lower right corner of the screen.
~
Try to master the 'Parry - Strike' combination first. Successfully parrying an opponent's attack will stun them and make them lose energy, giving you the opportunity to safely attack.
~
Use different types of attacks to understand which deals the most damage. Each weapon in the game has its preferred type of attack. Experiment!

OneToOneCave {Use of Terrain}
OneToOneCave_descr
{
If you are outnumbered, try to use the environment to gain an advantage in battle.
~
You can almost always find a place where you can force the enemy to fight you one-on-one or two at a time.

If you are outnumbered, try to use the environment to gain an advantage in battle.
~
You can almost always find a place where you can force the enemy to fight you one-on-one or two at a time.

Collision {Changing Position}
Collision_descr
{
Sometimes during a battle, it becomes necessary to change position, either by breaking through the enemy line or circumventing allies.
~
Exit combat mode so the hero can push other characters from your way. After changing positions, re-enter combat mode to continue fighting.
}

WorldMapEnglish {Global Map}
WorldMapEnglish_descr
{
The global map allows you to make sea voyages across the Caribbean. It is not necessary to sail exactly to each city or bay; just exit the global map in the vicinity of your target and use the 'Sail To' function.
~
Skillful use of the 'Sail to' function can significantly save time. For example, you can exit the global map on one side of the island, fast travel to reach a point on the other side, and then return to the global map.
~
Use hotkeys to zoom out on the map and to display the Atlas with maps.

LandMapEnglish {Traveling on Land}
LandMapEnglish_descr
{
Maps can be bought or found. Collect every island map you encounter to navigate around the landmass. This is especially useful in quests, colony infiltrations, and treasure hunting.
All collected maps can be found in the Atlas. 
}

NavigatorEnglish {Navigation Skill}
NavigatorEnglish_descr
{
Assign a Navigator with a sufficient Navigation skill!
~
Navigation primarily determines the size of ships that the character can manage.
~
For example, the fifth rank requires 25 points, while the fourth requires 45. Exceeding this limit will result in penalties to all character stats and skills.
~
Requirements for each ship rank can be seen by right-clicking on the Navigation skill icon in the character window.
~
The Navigation skill grows slowly, so hire experienced navigators in taverns at your first opportunity. However, keep in mind that you won't be able to find a specialist with a skill level above 75.

AlchemyEnglish {Crafting}
AlchemyEnglish_descr
{
Manufacturing items, primarily talismans, potions, and ammunition, can significantly ease your life. This is especially useful in boss fights.
~
To manufacture an item, you need to find or buy a recipe. Ingredients do not necessarily have to be carried with you; you can confidently buy various junk from street merchants and store it in one of the chests in the cabin.
~
At the beginning of the game, you have a choice: take the Alchemy skill and start buying recipes right away, or postpone this possibility until the mid-game, when you will have toolkits which will substitute for spending a valuable skill point on Alchemy.

Head to the opposite side of the island to complete your quest. Exit the bay to the right and stick to the shoreline!

SalaryEnglish {Ship Upkeep}
SalaryEnglish_descr
{
Monthly payments to officers and crew can significantly complicate the captain's life. The total amount depends on your Trading and Leadership skills, the ship's size, and the difficulty level.
~
Even on small ships, it's highly recommended to have a purser on board, while a large warship can bankrupt even a country. If the loot-sharing option is enabled, the payment amount can be even higher.

DubloonsEnglish {Doubloons}
DubloonsEnglish_descr
{
Golden doubloons are the true measure of your character's wealth and ability to solve problems with money. Always strive to earn these coins, as the most powerful people in the Caribbean only offer their services for doubloons.
~
Good sources of doubloons include treasure hunting, bank deposits, trading strategic goods, and exchanging currency at moneylenders. You don't need to carry gold with you; you can store it in one of the chests in your cabin.

}

BoxEnglish {Item Storage}
BoxEnglish_descr
{
The chests in your cabin can store an unlimited number of personal items. Besides mandatory equipment in your outfit slots, it's wise to carry only potions, amulets, and ammo with you.
~
Sell excess items, but always stash a reasonable reserve of jewelry, weapons, ammunition, and alchemy ingredients.
~
Other captains also follow this practice, so it's always worth searching the chests in the cabin of a captured ship.

}

HealthEnglish {Vitality}
HealthEnglish_descr
{
Your Vitality has decreased! This stat describes your character's general condition and affects all their abilities.
~
Vitality decreases from using primitive healing methods, dramatic story events, drunkenness, and overloading. 
~
It is restored by special potions, romantic activities, resting in a tavern, and simply over time. In severe cases, priests can help. Unique officers also lose Vitality if they are injured in combat, but they recover it over time.

}

AmuletEnglish {Amulets}
AmuletEnglish_descr
{
Amulets are powerful character boosters divided into offensive, defensive, and auxiliary. You cannot equip offensive and defensive amulets simultaneously, so choose wisely.
~
In addition to amulets, there are talismans and wards. Talismans last longer and have more extensive effects, while wards are immensely powerful, act indefinitely, and have a separate inventory slot.
~
Always keep several sets of boosters in your inventory for difficult skill checks and tough battles at sea and on land.

PerkEnglish {Perk Points}
PerkEnglish_descr
{
You've just received your first perk point (PP)! PPs are crucial for character development and are divided into Naval and Personal.
~
Naval Perks make you more dangerous at sea, while Personal Perks make you more effective on land and in interactions with people.
~
Both types of PP develop independently as your skills grow. On average, every 30 skill points in one group give you one PP.
~
To quickly gain Naval PP, complete sea side quests and contracts. Personal points grow faster if you fight with different weapons and spend quality time in taverns. Remember, personal PP is more valuable since most Naval Perks can be covered by your officers.

FighterEnglish {Vanguards}
FighterEnglish_descr
{
Your first Vanguard has joined the crew! Assign him via the Character Menu.
~
Vanguards are your most trusted officers, bodyguards, and boarders. They will follow you into the thick of the fight, and you'll spend most of your time with them.
~
You can lead up to three fighters at a time. Besides protecting you on land, Vanguards increase boarding efficiency and help carry heavy treasures.
~
Unique quest officers are different from regular sailors you can hire in taverns. Though not all are effective Vanguards, they significantly impact the game's storyline and cannot die in regular combat.
~
Always equip your Vanguards with amulets, healing items, weapons, and ammunition. You can exchange items through the action menu or any chest.
~
You can order the Vanguards to hold their position, follow the captain, or attack using hotkeys or through dialogue.

RestEnglish {Rest Option}
RestEnglish_descr
{
The Rest option is now available in the Action Menu!
~
Everything in the game follows a time cycle: guards are absent at the pier and city gates at night, you can only hire a crew in taverns during the day, and some characters are very particular about the time of day.
~
Use this function at sea and in the wild. Rent a room in a tavern if you are in a city.

Navigation{Ship Control}
Navigation_descr
{
Use the sail control keys to change the sail mode and the turn keys to change the course.
~
There are three sail modes: Full Sails, Battle Sails, and Furled Sails.
~
Full Sails mode allows maximum speed but you will turn slower and your ship's sail will be most vulnerable in battles and storms.
~
Battle Sails mode limits speed but improves turning, artillery accuracy, and gives your sails better protection from enemy fire.
~
Furled Sails mode gradually slows the ship to a complete stop. Very useful for boarding or collecting valuables from the sea.
~
The golden rule: in battle - Battle Sails mode is preferred; outside of battle - Full Sails Mode.

StealthEnglish{Stealth}
StealthEnglish_descr
{
You are not welcome in most of the Caribbean settlements. There are two ways to infiltrate a city: through the port or the gates.
~
Safe docking in an enemy port requires preparation. Raise the flag of a non-hostile country and have a high Stealth skill level before you risk appearing before fort guns.
~
Entering through the city gates is best done at night when they aren't guarded. Avoid soldiers and spend the night in a tavern. If you raise an alarm, find an empty house and wait there for a couple of hours before trying again.
~
Buying a trading license in Curacao is a safe option to travel around the region if your Stealth skill is low.
}

SeaBattle{Naval Combat}
SeaBattle_descr
{
The gist of any naval combat is to maintain your optimal course angle, preserve your sails, and damage the enemy's.
~
Use round shot and chain shot for the latter. Round shots have the longest range and deal moderate damage to hull and sails. One successful volley of chain shots at medium range can destroy the enemy's sails.
~
For higher accuracy, use First Person Mode after ensuring your ship isn't too rocked by waves or recent maneuvers. If you damage the enemy's sails and preserve yours, you have three options: boarding, sinking, or fleeing.
~
Exceeding a distance of a thousand yards from the nearest enemy ship lets you enter the global map and flee.
~
Sinking an enemy ship is easiest with bombs at close range. Effective long-range shooting with round shots is for experienced captains and cannoneers. Typically, a need to sink an enemy ship is rare, with battles mostly focused on boarding or fleeing.

BoardingTactics{Boarding}
BoardingTactics_descr
{
Before going for boarding, fire a few volleys of grapeshot to weaken the enemy crew without receiving the same response. Once you have the advantage, approach the enemy ship, match its speed, and engage!
~
The higher your Boarding Skill, the easier it will be to successfully grapple with the enemy ship. Boarding efficiency depends on your crew's size, skills, and morale.
~
Having an experienced boatswain, vanguards, amulets, and developed personal combat skills can offset the enemy's numerical advantage.
}

MushketEnglish{Muskets}
MushketEnglish_descr
{
Long-barreled firearms are extremely dangerous in battle. Only the main character with the Musketeer Skill and some unique officers can use them. 
The most notable example is Tichingitu, and he should be the one who gets the first musket you find.
~
Unlike melee weapons, firearms offer greater flexibility. By developing your character as a marksman, wearing certain amulets and equipment, and using different types of ammunition, you can turn the tide of any battle.
